* This paper is based in supervised machine learning (ML) in order to esmitate the heterogeneity in casual effects in certain experiments about mental studies developed by the authors Susan Athey and Guido W. Imbens. Some of the algorithms used to make predictions are *Random Forest*, *Regression Trees*, *K-Means*, *LASSO*, *Vector Support Machines*, etc. However, this paper is only focused in regression trees, in other words there four types of estimator for casual effects such as *casual trees* (CT), *Transformed outcomes Trees* (TOT), *Fit-based Trees* (F) and *Squared T-Statistic Trees* (TS), because these methods are able to produce a partition from the population according the covariates and all the units from de data receive the same partition. In addition to the above, This research use the *Cross Validation* (CV) to select certain the optimal level of *train* and *test* set from the data. In the next lines, I am going to explain the main parts of this paper with the porpuse to understand how the supervised machine learning works for the casual effects. 

* Firstly, the research introduce a new to term to work with statistic models called *Honesty*. The reason for it is becauses the researcher want to split the training sample in two different groups. One of them will be used to deploy the tree and the other one will be used to estimate the treatment effects within the tree. That is the origin of *Honesty* method, because many algorithms of supervised learning are not able to find a a certain partition from the data and then testing on treatment effects in order to build confidence intervals. In that sense, the researcher propose a new way of not imposing any restriction on the casual models to be built, due the priority target is the partition of covariates and make sure if any hypothesis has the expected effect to the treatment that researcher want to deploy in future investigations. 

* Secondly, another point to the discussion on this paper is about building the regression trees and the (CART) methodology, because this paper doesn´t keep the tradicional clasiffication tree. In this case, it is important to develop the CART algorithm, which it is based on tree regression. The importance of (CART) is becauses it split the observations of training sample. In other words, in each leaf, the algorithm use a certain criterion called *Splitting*. This approach is going to be used where the criterion of *Honesty* is better than any threshold. Then, its necessary to use the penalization to maximize one criterion of *Honesty* in validation samples. 

* Finally, in this section, the most important is the performance of algorithms using one simulation in each experiment. In that sense, the researcher had delevolped a report of some result for **500** and **1000** observations with each others. After that, the researcher realized that the likehood is around the 0,5 of the experiment. From the three simulations, the first one does not have any covariate that affect the treatment, minewhile the last two simulation affect to the treatment, but only when their signals are positive. However, despite the obstacles that arise in the different simulation deployed by the authors, the three simulations are able to support the honest estimation, but don´t take in consideration some effect treatment for **90%** of confidence intervals, which those are inside for *honesty* method.

* In conclusion, after analysing the methods explanied in the previous lines, it is understandable that this new proyect is very different from the other tradicional methods used in *Supervised Machine Learning* (SML), because the investigation only use the trees based on (ML) directly to the treatment in one stage. In addition to the above, there new approaches to deploy the decision tree based on machine Learning (ML) in order to solve the casual effects, which they are important to make hypothesis and inferences on experiments that use the  casual effects at certain studies. Also, the present study not only consider the tree to make casual effect, but also take the Cross Validation (CV) and the penalization due to estimate the treatment effects with every leaf.
