## Paper: Recursive Partitioning for Heterogeneous Causal Effects

### Student: Franco Caceres





In this article, the authors propose methods to estimate the heterogeneity of causal effects in causal and observational studies. So, what they are looking for is to try to observe and corroborate if these proposed methods bring any extra benefit to the traditional methods that they have. The traditional approach is the CART approach and the one proposed by the authors is the "honest" approach, which makes certain modifications to the traditional approach.

One of the strengths that can be highlighted from this article is that the "honest" estimation model explained in this article actually makes an improvement over the traditional CART approach. The first modification that is made is that an independent sample S_test is used instead of S_train to estimate the mean of the leaves of the regression trees. The second modification is made to the criteria for dividing the samples and cross-validation, proposing an "honest cross-validation" with which it is guaranteed that the overfitting of the traditional model will not be incurred.

It is also pertinent to mention that, as the objective of the research was planned, it will be possible to verify that if these new methods are used for the construction of causal trees, valid inferences of the causal effects can be made either in random experiments or observational studies. In addition, these new methods will be valid even for small samples with few observations as in the case of an experiment for a group of patients in a hospital.

A step forward in this research would be to show empirical cases of how these models can be applied in various cases and observe the results obtained from them in order to see if they are consistent with the theory.
