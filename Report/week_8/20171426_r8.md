# Report 8: Recursive Partitioning for heterogeneous Causal Effects
 
 Athey and Imbens (2015) introduces us a method, Causal Tree, to select subgroups of a population that participated in a experiment (or not, under some assumptions) in order to estimated a better average treatment effects or to test the difference betweent this in groups that were not considered initially. This is built on regression trees, and under the aproach of "honesty". 
 
 This means that the data set is split ("honest splitting") into two groups, one in which the partitions are built and one in which the CATEs are estimated. This has a cost (relatively less observations in each phase), but also a gain (avoids the problem of adaptative estimation that used the whole sample and concentrates extremes values of the result variable in one leave, lifting the mean effect).
 
  In order to prove this, it relies on the assumption of complete randomization for experimental datasets and uses a MSE criteria for defining the optimal splitting.  This can be used even in modest data set and can be used as a complementation helps investigators to further their research in certain subgroups. 

  Also, they built 4 estimators: Causal Tree (CT) estimators, Transformed Outcome Trees (TOT), Fit-based Trees (F) and Squared T-statistic Trees (TS). The first one has the problem that we can't observe the value of the treatment effect whose conditional mean we aim to estimate. The alternative estimators have their own characteristics, too: the second one uses a transformed version of the outcome (however, it's not efficient), the third one is based on comparisons of the goodness-of-fit of the outcome rather the treatment effect, and the fourth one is based on trying to look for split that give us the largest values fot he squared of the t-statistic in order to test whether the ATE is the same between subgroups or leaves.  
  
  Finally, once estimated the partition of the tree, we focuse on estimating this in each part of the covariates splitted spaces. This is estimated using the honest estimation and doesn't assump any model complexity.
