## Recursive Partioning for Heterogeneous Causal Effects

Athey & Imbens

The article focuses on methods to solve the problem where there are many attributes of a unit in relation to the number of units observed, and where the functional form of the relationship between the effects of the treatment and the attributes of the units is unknown. Therefore, it is necessary to estimate heterogeneity in causal effects in experimental and observational studies. Hypothesis testing on the magnitude of differences in treatment effects in a subset of the population. Regression tree methods will support this approach, it can produce a population partition according to the heterogeneity of the treatment effect in the context of randomization.

To do that, they have two challenges for applied regression trees: First, is that many machine learning methods cannot be used directly to build confidence intervals. It calls adaptive methods, where the biases disappear only slowly as the sample size increases. The authors construct an alternative that does not impose restrictions on the complexity of the model, which we refer to as "honesty". It's called the honesty method. The main characteristics are that it does not use the same information to select the model structure and estimate given a model structure. Build the training sample divided into two parts, one to make the tree with cross-validation and the second to estimate the effect of the treatment within the leaf of the trees. Even if the precision is reduced due to the splitting of the sample, there is a benefit to the fit in terms of removing the bias that offsets at least part of the cost. Second, regularization approaches based on cross-validation are generally based on observing the basic truth, that is, the actual results in a cross-validation sample. If you minimize the root mean square error of treatment effects, you can find the fundamental problem of causal inference.

Subsequently, the authors detailed many changes in expectations of the effects of conditional mean treatment (CATE). They make new estimators on the expectation of the CATE, the variance, the mean square error in the case of honest estimation and they compare with the adaptive method, especially when they use the estimators by cross-validation, treatment effect and results. In addition, they describe the other partition estimators for the causal effects (causal trees, the fit criterion, and the t-squared statistical criterion) and make inferences. In addition, they conduct a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the algorithms.
