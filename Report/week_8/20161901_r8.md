### Student: Alexander Pacheco (20161901)

The authors in the paper introduce methods to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects. For this purpose, they do not restric the number of covariates used in the estimations and divide the data into subpopulations or subspaces. Their 'honest' approach allows them to do inference for causal effects through the construction of confidence intervals for their estimates.

The strength of the paper is its theoretical and practical approach. The authors present the mathematics underlying their methods and then they apply them in a simulated data. This process makes the reader better understand the paper.

The main contributions of the paper are the applications for which its methods can be used: data-mining, medical studies and economics.

The next steps could be to try their methods in new subpopulations and real data that allow researches to apply this technique in different fields of sciences.
