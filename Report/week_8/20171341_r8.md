* Paper: Recursive Partitioning for Heterogeneous Causal Effects

Athey and Imbens (2019) aim to propose new methods to address  heterogenity of  causal effects (and to conduct inference about those differences). To do so the use causal trees approach and the use of $honest$ methods. 

First, authors define $honest$ tree as a tree which uses one subsample of the training data to split the data and another subsample to estimate the treatment effect within leaves of the tree. Authors mention that the use of honest trees derive in  improvements on the fitting because of bias reduction (bias  could arise if the estimating data is the same as the splitting data). However, there's a trade-off between these improvements and sample size (which is reasonable since we split our training data in two subsamples).

Authors then precise more on Inference of population averages. They first define the set up of the problem and then they contrast  honest target (where there are specific subsamples for splitting and for estimation ) with adaptive taget (estimation subsample is the same as the splitting one). 

After explaining what's behind the inference of population averages with CART, authors now aim to estimate CATE using the CART framework. The key point here is that , in contrast with the previous part, we don't know the real value of the Treatment Effect ($\tau_{i}$). To address this problem authors assume these treatment effect as a constant within leaves.

To conclude, authors compare many proposals to find how Honest trees perform. As expected, they find that honest trees perform slightly better than adaptive methods.

Finally, we could remark that although most of the paper is focused on randomized designs it also poses the case of observational data by using propensity scores.
