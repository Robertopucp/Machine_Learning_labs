<p style='text-align: justify;'> Lately, there are some attempts to apply supervised machine learning techniques to the problem of estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, thus this research applies machine learning methods directly to the treatment effect. In this context, this paper proposes new methods for estimating heterogeneity in causal effects in randomized experiments and observational studies, specifically new methods for constructing trees in two ways. On the one hand, the authors propose methods that allow the estimation of causal effects in randomized experiments. On the other hand, methods that comply with the assumption of unconfoundedness for observational studies. Additionally, these methods are used to make hypothesis tests about the magnitude of the differences in treatment effects across subsets of the population. These methods are based on the regression tree method, which assumes an honest approach for estimation to eliminate bias, in this way these methods aim to improve the prediction of treatment effects without restrictions on the number of covariates or the complexity of the data generating process. Also, these methods derive confidence intervals for treatment effects for each subspace and optimize the goodness of fit. In few words, this paper develops new methods for constructing trees for heterogeneous causal effects in randomized experiments and in observational studies. 

<p style='text-align: justify;'> From my point of view, the article has several advantages, firstly, it develops formal definitions in a broad and detailed way, which helps to understand the proposals and contributions of the research, secondly, the research is not reduced to just a theoretical proposal, but develops a simulation exercise to compare the research approach with other approaches, where it makes a cost-benefit analysis of using an honest estimation approach. Thirdly, another advantage is that it compares the partitioning estimator for causal effects derived from the research, CT estimator, with eight other estimators in their adaptive and honest version through simulations, this exercise helps to strengthen and differentiate the proposal from other approaches. However, a disadvantage is that, despite the fact that the text argues that the methods can be adapted for observational studies under the assumption of unconfoundness, an example is not developed, taking into account that the objective of the study was to verify that these methods were applicable for experimental data and observational studies, I consider that the application to observational studies deserved further development.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> A key contribution of this paper is that is possible to estimate these criteria proposed and use those for splitting and cross-validation, but even a novel contribution is that these criteria change when honest estimation is anticipated. As these methods can completely be applied to randomized experiments and observational studies under unconfoundness, one next step could consist of using these methods for medical randomized control trials, or economic observational studies with unconfoundness.
