# REPORT 8: Recursive Partitioning for Heterogeneous Causal Effects

The main purpose of this paper is to be able to estimate heterogeneity according to covariates or characteristics in case effects in experimental and observational studies, as well as to be able to make inferences between treatment groups of the subpopulation as a whole.

One of the strengths of this article is the ability and robustness of the theoretical and practical arguments through simulation exercises. These simulation exercises were carried out by evaluating the costs and benefits of an honest estimate. In addition, in order to compare the results of this study, it was compared with the old literature and also compared with previous approaches. Finally it is necessary to mention that very gratifying results were found, the approach employed by the authors through honest estimation presented results that indicated an improvement in the fit, in some cases very large, these comparisons with respect to the slightly more traditional "adaptive" approach.

One of the methods used in the authors' approach was honest averaging inference, which consisted of estimating conditional average treatment effects rather than predicting outcomes. Secondly, the construction of partitions is imposed, in order to subsequently estimate the effects within this partition sheet, using samples separated by two tasks, which is what is called "honest" estimation.

On the other hand, it is necessary to mention the four partitioning estimates for causal effects, which in turn is divided into 4 methods. The first estimation method is causal trees. The second estimation method is transformed outcome trees (TOT). The third estimation method is the Fit-Based Trees (F). Finally, we have the estimation method of Squared T-statistic Trees (TS). It is necessary to mention that all four estimations exist in both their adaptive and honest versions and in changes cases there are pros and cons of using either approach. 

Finally, one of the valuable and specific steps to advance in this research question is to be able to apply all the methodologies presented in field experiments or medical studies, in order to be able to translate these models and apply them to reality. This would make it easier to identify subpopulations that are at average values of those expected.
