Because in experimental or observational studies there is the presence of heterogeneity in causal effects and that so far, the methods applied did not dissipate this problem, the authors propose a new method called Honest Tree, in addition, this new method allows hypothesis testing on the magnitude of the differences in treatment effects between different subgroups of the population.

The strength of the paper is that the authors present step by step how to apply their method and compare it with the conventional CART method that was mostly applied up to that moment and how modifications to it allow to achieve a better estimation. In addition, the authors present 3 alternative types of estimators (Transformed Outcome Trees, Fit-based Trees and Squared T-statistic Trees) apart from their Casual Trees estimator and compare them. Finally, they perform a simulation that allows comparing the advantages of the honest estimation versus the adaptive method where, although there are costs when applying the new method, the results were better than the adaptive method

Before the honest method, the method for partitioning the data was the adaptive method, however, this generated an overfitting problem caused by the adaptive estimation. Therefore, they contribute with their Honest tree method, where the data is subdivided into two: training data and estimation data. Likewise, the training data is subdivided to build the trees and estimate the treatment effects within the leaves of the tree. 

Since it is a new method, an advance for this area would be to apply it in randomized studies already applied to compare the results with other methods. In addition, new study areas can be covered or subgroups can be analyzed that were previously not possible due to methodological limitations.
