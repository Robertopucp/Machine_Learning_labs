This article proposes methods to estimate heterogeneity in experimental and causal effects. In addition, to perform hypothesis tests for the treatments of the different population sets. What is striking in this study is the analysis in a small group of observations and different covariates. This particular case can be observed in clinical trials where there are few patients with a large number of different characteristics. In this way, the authors focus on the objective of deriving a population share according to the heterogeneity of the treatment effect, with the help of the causal trees.

Also, to carry out the methods they run into two important problems: first, the estimation by covariates in the causal effects in observational and experimental studies. Second, the number of inferences that can be made from differences in the causal effects of treating subsets of the population. Furthermore, the authors compare their methods, that is, the approach they take with those proposed above.

This papper is very useful to be able to estimate situations where we do not have a restriction of observations and the number of covaribals, for which I consider that it complies correctly as the whole solution develops. The result they find is a set of treatment effects and confidence intervals for each subspace. As I mentioned, the main focus of this study is to help the development of medical studies or field experiments in developed economics.
