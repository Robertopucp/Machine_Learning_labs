The authors of the assigned article find new methods for estimating the heterogeneity of causal effects in experimental and observational cases, using an approach, based on regression tree methods, that partitions the data into subpopulations differing in the magnitude of their treatment effects. Regression trees are modified to optimize goodness-of-fit for treatment effects and for estimation. In this way, they obtain valid confidence intervals that include samples with many covariates and no sparsity assumptions. Thus, they use one sample to construct a partition and another to estimate the treatment effects in each subpopulation. By doing so, honest estimation reduces or eliminates bias and takes into consideration the change in variance of the treatment effect estimates in each subpopulation. This honest approach is tested in a simulation that obtains improvements in confidence interval coverage by achieving nominal coverage rates without the need to adjust for treatment effects.

The approach used differs from classification and regression trees because, in this paper, they focus on the estimation of conditional mean treatment effects and not on prediction, also, they impose a separation between the construction of the partition and the estimation of the effects within each leaf of the trees, by using separate samples for both tasks, which will allow to contrast the honest estimation with the adaptive one. For the honest objective, the mean squared error criteria are used to compare the alternative estimators; while for the adaptive objective, the same training sample is used to construct and estimate the tree.

In addition, in the honest inference of treatment effects, the approach is changed to estimate the conditional mean treatment effects instead of the conditional population means, through the "causal tree" estimators. Along with these, four partition estimators are used for the causal effects, the main one being the causal tree estimator which is compared with the other alternatives. Each of them has its adaptive part and its honest version, of which the estimation is done on a different sample from the one that allowed the partition, which ends up obtaining 8 estimators. Apart from the causal trees, there are transformed causal trees to focus the partitioning and cross-validation on the treatment effects but not on the results, only that it does not use the information of the treatment indicator other than only for the construction of the transformed result. Fit-based trees make a choice of which characteristic and which value to split on, based on goodness-of-fit comparisons of the outcome and not on treatment effects. Finally, t-squared statistic trees look for the largest value of the square of the statistic to test the null hypothesis that the mean treatment effect is the same on the two potential leaves.

Given these methods, it is inferred that the standard approaches are valid for estimates obtained through estimation without the need for assumptions about model complexity. For adaptive methods, standard approaches to confidence intervals are generally not valid. Also, simulations test the effectiveness of honest estimation by sacrificing some goodness-of-fit for treatment effects in exchange for valid confidence intervals. Consequently, what is found from these new causal effects tree methods is valid inference in randomized and observational experiments without restrictions on the number of covariates or complexity in data generation. Thus, by dividing the sample into small subspaces, sets of treatment effects and confidence intervals are found for each of them.
