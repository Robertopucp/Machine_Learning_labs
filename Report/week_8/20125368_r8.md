Recursive Partitioning for Heterogeneous Causal Effects

The authors try to estimate the heterogeneity by covariates or characteristics in the causal effects in 
experimental or observational studies. Also, they try to make inferences about the magnitude of the 
differences in the treatment effects between subsets of the population.

Since many methods can't be used directly to construct confidence intervals, so, the "honest" approach 
is used, which imposes no constraints on the complexity of the model: it does not use the same 
information to select the partition of the covariate space and for estimation, given a structure of the 
model. 

In this sense, the contribution of this paper in the literature is that it shows that the 
criteria for constructing participation and cross-validation change when "honest" validation is anticipated.
The strength of the method used in this research is that it allows researchers to identify heterogeneity 
in treatment effects that were not specified in a previous analysis plan, without worrying about 
invalidating inferences due to concerns about multiple tests. This approach is designed for 
applications where there are many attributes for a unit, relative to the number of units observed, and where
the functional form of the relationship between the effects of treatment and the attributes of the treated 
units is not known.
