The paper provides an approach where data are divided into subpopulations in the methods to estimate the heterogeneity of causal effects for observational and experimental studies by means of honest estimation. This will be done by implementing regression trees that have been modified to optimize goodness of fit. To achieve this, two related problems will be studied where the first is to estimate the heterogeneity by covariates or characteristics of the causal effects in observational or experimental studies; and the second is associated with inferences of the magnitude of differences in treatment effects between subsets of the population.

One of the points in favor of the approach used is that it can be applied to situations where there are many attributes of a unit in relation to the number of units observed and on the other hand, a point against the objective of finding a partition and then testing a hypothesis of the effects of the treatment, would be that most of the automatic learning methods cannot be used directly for the construction of the confidence intervals. Another challenge is the fundamental problem of causal inference, which will be addressed by the construction of unbiased estimates using the mean square error. The authors, for this study, use the honesty approach, where no restrictions are imposed on the complexity of the model. In this sense, a model will be considered as "honest" if it uses different information for the selection of the structure of a model and for the estimation of a given structure.

A specific contribution of the article is to point out that the criteria for the partition construction and for cross-validation will change in anticipation of an honest estimate. This is carried out in two stages, in the first the criterion will be the expectation of mean square error and for the second stage these estimates will be unbiased. In general, authors contribute with new tree methods for causal effects with which inferences are valid for observational and experimental experiments where the number of covariates or the complexity of the data generating process is not restricted.

A step forward, which is mentioned at the end of the document, could be to apply this new methodology in medical studies or field experiments for a specific area of our career, developed economy.
