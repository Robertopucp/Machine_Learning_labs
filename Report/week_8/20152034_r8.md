Recursive partition for heterogeneous effects

-----

The article proposes methods to estimate the heterogeneity in the causal effects of mental experiments and for hypothesis tests the differences between the effects of the treatment of the subpopulations. This allows valid confidence intervals even with many covariates.

An honest approach is proposed in which one sample is used to partition and another to estimate treatment effects by subpopulation. It is based on the regression tree method used to optimize the goodness of fit in the effects of the treatment group. In addition, it takes into account the change in the variance of the effect estimates within each subset of the population.

A simulation study is carried out where an honest approach results with confidence intervals with greater coverage without much adjustment treatment. The honest approach is contracted with adaptive estimation. An adaptive estimation problem compared to an honest one is that the spurious external values ​​are placed on the same sheet as other extreme values ​​and thus the sample of means are more extreme than an independent sample would be. In the traditional method to avoid overfitting a penalty term is added. On the other hand, for the honest estimation algorithm, the sample is modified to estimate the means with an independent one and the division and cross-validation criteria are modified.

To validate the relative performance, a simulation is run in each design for the appropriate covariates, the treatment effects, and the mean results. For example 1 does not have noise covariates and the others affect the sample number. adaptive versions tend to have shallower trees. These methods allow us to give as results a set of effects and confidence intervals for each subspace.
