The authors, in this paper, try to construct valid confidence intervals for treatment effects by using an ‘honest’ approach. The method that they propose tries to do something that other machine learning methods can’t do, and this is the construction of a confidence interval in a direct way. To do so, they split the training sample in two, one part is for the tree and the other one is for the estimation of treatment effect of the leaves in the tree.

The approach is based in conventional classification and regression tress (CART) and take to account two important factors. First, they center attention in estimating conditional average treatment effects. Second, they also do a separation between the construction of the splitting and the estimation of the effects within the leaves of the partition. To prove that their method allows them to accomplish their goal, they compare the results between their “honest” approach and the usual CART method that is more commonly used. 

At the end, their method accomplishes their objective, which was to build valid confidence intervals and calculate treatment effects for each subspace of the sample. This method that they created permit to do valid inference for the casual effects with the ensure that the unconfoundedness assumption is fulfilled.
