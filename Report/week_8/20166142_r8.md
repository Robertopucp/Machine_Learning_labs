<p style='text-align: justify;'>The authors propose methods to estimate the heterogeneity of causal effects in experimental and observational studies in the article. They present four partitioning estimators for causal effects: causal trees (CT), transformed outcome trees (TOT), fit-based trees (F), and T-squared trees (TS). Moreover, something important to highlight is that the authors develop these methods in two estimation approach: honest and adaptive. The main proposal of the authors is the honest approach to estimation. Honest estimation is when the same data are not used to establish the model structure (partitioning) and estimate causal treatment effects. In other words, one subsample is used to construct the data partition and another to estimate the heterogeneous effects in each subset of data. Therefore, the authors throughout the paper seek to answer: is the honest approach better than the adaptive approach when estimating heterogeneous treatment effects?

<p style='text-align: justify;'>To answer this question, the authors attempt to evaluate the costs and benefits of honest estimation. To do so, the authors begin with the theoretical development of the methods shown. Although the authors elaborate more on the causal trees than on the other methods presented, I think it is essential that the authors make a short theoretical development of the alternative methods and explain some important points of each one. Then, they presented a simulation study comparing honest estimation with other methods mentioned above. This simulation finds that honest estimation costs adjusting for treatment effects, i.e., precision is lost due to a reduction in the sample size used for training. However, valid confidence intervals are obtained, even when there are many covariates compared to the sample size used.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>As a contribution, the authors provide new statistical tools to estimate the heterogeneity of the treatment effect for each population subgroup, allowing researchers to let the same data discover relevant subsets without the risk that hypothesis testing may invalidate confidence intervals. Another contribution that the same authors comment on is that the criteria used for constructing the model structure and cross-validation would change if honest estimation is applied.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>To advance methodologically in the partitioning of the data, a significant problem found by the authors occurs when a covariate strongly affects the mean of the results, but not the treatment effects, which causes the mean of the treatment group sample to change, but not that of the control. Then, there will be a variation in the estimated difference in treatment effects. At the same time, the authors propose a solution for this by using a parameter representing the target number of observations per "bucket". Although the authors find that this improves the goodness of fit on average, it is not certain to occur in all cases. Therefore, this line of research could be advanced.
