In this paper, Athey and Imbens propose new methods for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, and to look for differences in treatment effects between subsets of the population. The estimation is also done without restricting the number of covariates included in the model, which allows for constructing models where the number of observations is relatively smaller than the number of variables. This is done through the estimation of regression trees and partitioning the data, using what the authors propose as the _honest approach_, in contrast to the _adaptive apporach_ where spurious correlations may introduce bias to the estimation. The former assures that there are different samples used for selecting and estimating the model structure, meanwhile the latter uses training data. 

The paper presented both a theoretical approach, where the authors walk the readerâ€™s through the math behind the methods being proposed and a practical approach, where a simulation study is presented in order to contrast the different methods (comparative and adaptive)  and assess the goodness-of-fit of the model. This makes the work understandable in a friendly way to the reader, though since the paper tries to tackle different topics not all of those are explained thoroughly.

The main contribution of this paper, as the authors point out, is the introduction of the honest approach, which is useful in the estimation of treatment effects with valid confidence intervals, using the available data optimally.

To further analyze the approach, it is necessary to test it using real data and contrast it against different models and estimation methods. This will help to know how the honest approach can perform with data out of a simulation, and how it is different from other approaches. It is also worth questioning how the different assumptions hold, especially the one of unconfoundedness outside of RCTs.
