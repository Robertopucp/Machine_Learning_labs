Recursive Partitioning for Heterogeneous Causal Effect

The author in this article attempts to propose the "honest" approach as a method for estimating the heterogeneity of causal effects in both experimental and observational studies, and, in addition, for making inferences about the magnitude of differences in treatment effects among subsets of the population. Simply put, this approach tells us that a model is "honest" when it does not use the same information for selecting the model structure and for estimation given a model structure. And this is achieved by splitting the training sample into two parts, one for building the tree and the other for estimating the treatment effects within the leaves of the tree. 

Among the author's strengths are both theoretical and practical arguments, I mean simulation. In addition, he takes the time to explain a bit in order to differentiate this new approach from the conventional approach (classification and regression approach). 	Personally, I would have liked a little more theoretical framework of the subject and in more depth in the literature review section. I understand that it was decided to publish the article because of the novelty of the approach that allowed to do what, perhaps others did not, that allows valid inference for causal effects in randomized experiments and in observational studies, that satisfies disconfirmation, no restrictions for the number of covariates. And, it allows the construction of a confidence interval for each subspace (considering that not many machine learning methods can be used to directly construct confidence intervals).

The same author mentions that one of the novel contributions of the paper is that it shows that the criteria, both for partition construction and cross-validation, change when an honest estimate is anticipated. That is, in the first stage of estimation the criterion is the expectation of the mean squared error when re-estimating treatment effects in the second stage. Since the second-stage estimates are anticipated to be unbiased, then the splitting and cross-validation criteria focus on a tighter prediction and on the variance arising from the second stage (honest estimation). Another contribution is that while what the author proposes, which is to minimize the mean squared error of the treatment effects, the fundamental problem of causal inference arises, so the author proposes approaches to construct unbiased estimates of the mean squared error of the causal treatment effect.
