Nowadays, statistics has become an important tool in research processes, since it allows planning research, collecting, organizing, representing, interpreting and analyzing information about individuals or observations of a phenomenon under study: common characteristic, in a population or in a sample. The analysis allows describing information behaviors, drawing conclusions and giving recommendations for decision-making. For this, the so-called causal inference has been used for quite a few decades. It has already had interference in many areas of the medical, social, psychological, economic sciences, etc. In this case, I will explain a bit about causal trees (a machine learning model). In this sense, Susan Athey & Guido W. Imbens in their article "Recursive Partitioning for Heterogeneous Causal Effects" provides us with a tool that introduces us to understand the use of recursive partitioning in causal trees. Next, I will describe some points about the article.

First of all, I will begin by stating the goal of the authors' research. The authors try to answer the question: The research question was: Does honest estimation give better results in fit compared to a more traditional “adaptive” estimation approach?.

Secondly, I will highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the article's approach to answer the research question.

For one thing, one of the main strengths of the article is that in the first place, it describes the classic problems that an evaluation of the impact of a particular treatment presents, such as the unconfoundedness and the conditional average effects of a treatment so that the reader is situated on the subject to be treated.

In addition, another of the main strengths of the article is that it provides inferences comparing the honest estimate with the traditional estimate, as well as inferences for the effects of treatment. The authors do this with the aim of mathematically presenting sufficient evidence (in terms of variance comparison, mean squared errors, and so on) to ensure that a best estimate would be given through honest estimation.

Morover, another of the main strengths of the article is that, since the method itself incurs in partitioning in samples for causal effects, it compares the estimators (causal trees, transformed result trees, adjustment-based trees and T-statistic squared trees) both of the adaptive version like the honest version.

Thirdly, the contribution of this article is that it shows that the test for both partition construction and cross-validation change when we anticipate an honest estimate. That happens because the split and cross-validation test are adjusted to ignore bias in the estimation and instead focus on having a more personalized prediction, that is, a smaller leaves size and the variance that will arise in an honest estimation due to noisy estimation within small leaves.

Finally, this new method contributes because it shows a set of treatment effects and confidence intervals for each subspace. A next challenge would be to modify the standard approach for cross-validation since causal effects are not observed for individual units.
