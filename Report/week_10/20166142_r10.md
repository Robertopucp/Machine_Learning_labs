<p style='text-align: justify;'>Hedonic prices were introduced as a way to address the product entry and exit bias in price indexes. These hedonic price functions explain prices as a function of product characteristics so that the price difference between new and old products is not only due to inflation. The authors propose an estimation of hedonic prices using artificial intelligence models such as neural networks. Therefore, the following article revolves around one central idea: is it more appropriate to use neural network models than other estimation models (linear regression or trees) to estimate hedonic prices and their indices?

<p style='text-align: justify;'>In the article, the authors provide a theoretical explanation of the proposed approach and the steps to be followed to arrive at the estimation of hedonic prices and the construction of hedonic price indexes. For the development of the approach, two important steps are found. The first step is converting text and image information about the product into embeddings. The text information is converted into numeric features using ELMO or BERT deep learning models. A pre-trained ResNet50 model is used along the same lines to produce the embeddings for the product images. In the second step, the hedonic price function is estimated using multitask neural networks. In addition, the models used in this step are trained to predict prices simultaneously over the whole period. In the first step, the models are trained on tasks not related to price prediction, such as predicting words, sentences, or image classification, among others. After estimating the hedonic prices, they construct Fisher's hedonic price indexes of monthly, annual, and combined GEKS types.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>In addition, it presents the results of an application of the hedonic price models using Amazon data for first-party apparel sales. The results showed that the neural network models have better out-of-sample predictive performance than the tree-based method, and the tree-based method, in turn, obtains better predictive performance than the linear regression method. Among the neural network models, the multitask neural network model (with a predictive accuracy ranging from 80% to 90%) performs better than the single task ones. Also, BERT-based multitask neural networks almost uniformly outperforms ELMO-based multitask neural networks. Thus, up to 90% of the price variation can be caused by variation in product features.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>The paper develops an essential contribution to the empirical microeconomics literature on hedonic pricing models, as it contributes to their modernization, their application on large-scale data. Studies related to hedonic pricing have been conducted using random forest methods rather than the neural network embeddings in text descriptions and product images proposed in the approach of this paper. Furthermore, through the hedonic pricing approach, a contribution is made to the literature regarding alternative tools for inflation measurement. While the paper provides a theoretical description and an empirical application, I find that it does not explain in detail how the number of hidden layers is determined and the number of neurons to be used in the process. It is not mentioned whether these should be assigned randomly or whether the level of prediction obtained varies when a greater or lesser number of hidden layers and neurons are used.
