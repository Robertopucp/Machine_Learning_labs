As inflation indices are important inputs into measuring aggregate productivity and 
cost of living, and conducting monetary and economic policy, authors of this paper seek to contribute to the science of inflation measurement based on quality- adjusted prices. However, there are many challenges that need to be faced. For instance, there are millions of products in the market as a result of the global trade environment. This latter leads to the constant change of the prices, sometimes these may be changed algorithmically by sellers. 
Moreover, there is an extremely high turnover for some products frm month to month. 

In line with this, authors addressed these challenges to produce a method that utilizes scalable 
ML and AI tools to predict quality-adjusted prices using text and image 
embedding. In this light, they use an advanced machine learning approach that includes encoding image data as inputs into price predictions. Overall, this technique provides novel methodology for encoding images via machine learning. Also, they use quantity-share weights in their implementation of hedonic price indices with ML methods. 

Min results were that Deep learning embeddings work as input features for hedonic price models, and that Random Forest and other Machine Learning models lead to superior price prediction.
