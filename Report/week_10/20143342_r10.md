The paper presents empirical pricing models and derives their hedonic form to measure changes in customer welfare. It modernizes hedonic price models, their application to large scale data and contributes to the application in the measurement of inflation. Also, its approach is new by developing a modern hedonic pricing model with a scale based on neural network embeddings for product text and image descriptions, and its data is characterized as unique by covering a universe of apparel products that are objects of transactions on Amazon.

The objective of this approach is to estimate the hedonic price function, thus, abstract attributes of the product to be analyzed or features are generated using deep neural networks. In other words, textual information about the product is converted into numerical features through ELMO or BERT linguistic models, and the image of the product is converted into numerical features with the ResNet50 model. For the formulation of the estimated function, the multitask neural network is used, which predicts the price of a product simultaneously in all the time periods to be reviewed.

The application of the model is performed on Amazon data on first-hand clothing sales to estimate hedonic prices, obtaining a good predictive accuracy with a high coefficient of determination and close to the fitted regression data. Then, the approach used can attribute up to 90% of the price variation to the variation of the items coding the product attributes. The performance is found to be remarkable for producing fully automatic and scalable hedonic prices without relying on any human-derived feature extraction, and because the results suggest that hedonic pricing models of the economy provide a good first-order approximation to prices. In addition, Fisher hedonic price indexes (HFPI) of monthly, annual and combined GEKS type are constructed for the years between 2013 and 2017, this in order to compare with the hedonic index, which in turn, will be made with the Jevons index of published prices, the BLS Urban CPI index for apparel and the Adobe Digital Price index. Such comparisons suggest that the price level of apparel decreased over the selected period and provided an improvement in customer welfare.

The main results show the usefulness of hedonic models to characterize prices and the decline of the Fisher price index when adjusting for quality in the apparel sector. This is different from other work that has used random forest methods without image embeddings or, if image embeddings have been used, have only characterized sources as products to analyze the effect of fusion on the product differentiation decisions of source producers.
