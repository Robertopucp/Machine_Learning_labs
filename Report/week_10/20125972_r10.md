## Hedonic prices and quality adjusted price indices powered by AI

Bajari, Patrick

2021

The authors focus on estimating the hedonic price function because this helps to simplify the relationship between different prices and characteristics of goods sold in differentiated products. In this way a distinction can be made between new and older products. So they develop many models to measure changes in clients based on well-being. To do this, they will use an approach by looking at a modern hedonic pricing model with neural network inlay-based scaling for product text and image descriptions relative to Amazon products.

They have two reasons to trust the accuracy of hedonic models:
 Hedonic pricing production is fully automatic and scalable, and does not rely on any human-based feature extraction.

These methods help us to make a good approximation.

In subsequent chapters of the article, they use the Word2Vec Embeddings algorithm, Embeddings Format Language Models (ELMO), Transformers xd Bidirectional Encoder Representations (BERT), and compare the latter two. Finally, they do the ResNet50 construction to exploit the partial linearity. And use data on them.

The results of the hedonic models have a high predictive precision for several product categories, with an R2 that varies between 80% and 90%.
