### Article: Hedonic prices and quality adjusted price indices powered by AI
### Author: Bajari and others 

<p align="justify">The authors develop empirical models of hedonic prices that derive to find changes in consumer welfare, based on deep learning. These methods have been discussed previously, where they seek to find the prices of the products based on the characteristics of the product rather than the product per se. However, traditional methods have had problems in the representation of images and/or high-dimensional texts and it is here where the research questions that guide the following article arise: When human experts succeed, what is the underlying fundamental reason (characteristics in high dimension)? Can this success be replicated by machine learning methods, and can these methods deliver scalable inference?<br>
<br>
The authors answer the question using a neural network model, first converting the information from text to numerical characteristics with an ELMO or BERT model, then converting the image into numerical characteristics as well using a ResNet50 model, and then based on this information predict hedonic prices using neural networks (again) with high predictive precision for various product categories with an r-square of 80% to 90%. As an empiric example they predict the hedonic prices of clothes in Amazon, they take into account both product characteristics, inflation, and changes in preferences (by seasons and years).<br>
<br>
The strengths of the approach are that the production of hedonic prices is completely automatic and scalable, without any extraction of human-based characteristics, in addition, the performance provides a good first-order approximation, this is because online prices change more frequently than other prices, changes in supply and demand can be observed in a more "pure" way. <br>
Regarding their weaknessess, it cannot be transpolated to all types of products since it presents judgment biases. Another shortcoming in the method is that the common set of products over time is small and unrepresentative, which is true in the empirical projections shown in the paper.<br>
<br>
Despite this, the contribution to the literature is important, the use of alternative and modern techniques and data to measure inflation and other aggregate quantities is something never seen before in economic history. A unique study on hedonic pricing on data sets including real-time availability with daily frequencies, low collection costs, large product counts, and uncensored pricing spells, with use of neural networks for text descriptions and product images.<br>
<br>
The next steps in the development of the research question would be the replication of the results in a greater variety of consumer goods, knowing the limits of the method and solidifying its strengths. The use of neural networks in economics is a vast yet unexplored field full of possibilities that will take predictions to a new level that adapts to current data availability.</p><br>
