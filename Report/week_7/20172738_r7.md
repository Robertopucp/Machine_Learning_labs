***
The main research question is know how the causal works in  treatments effects. The study was made with the national study of learning mindsets data and aim to know the performance of the causal forest in estimating treatment effects. 
    
    
 I think that the approach of the research is correct because is the correct method to manage the estimating treatment  effect but in the process of the investigation a few problems appear in relation with sample. Despite those unexpected issues the paper claryfies  and accept that maybe in this case this 2 main challenges are goint to affect the results. This to issues in the paper are related to the treatment group and is that students with a higher expectation of success appear to be more likely to receive treatment. This can affect the final result and add some bias. On the other hand, there seems to be a heterogenity among schools that can alter the treatments effects. As I mention before, this weak points are realted to the sample but I think that maybe is because their use synthentic data and this could be the origin of this sample problems. 
   
This paper explore and propose an approach to the problem of heterogenity treatment effect accros groups as in this case. Each school has a weigth on the mindset of their student. This affect the research but the authors propose a solution that can be explore in the future and is how the paper ends. They let an open question about to develop a better understanding of the pros and cons of different approaches to heterogeneous treatment effect estimation on clustered data. I think that is a aggregated value to the academic field that they surely are going to study.
