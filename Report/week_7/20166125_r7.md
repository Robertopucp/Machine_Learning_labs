The authors of this article aim to develop a causal forest model that can solve the problems of heterogeneous treatment effects when analyzing a database from the National Study of Learning Mindsets.
This study mentioned collects data from different schools and what it wants to study is the impact of an intervention in schools to instill in students a growth mindset in student achievement.

The study is done with simulated data to protect the privacy of the students. However, it is mentioned that this study has 2 problems to deal with. The first is that the synthetic data does not seem to be entirely random, since it presents selection effects, so it will proceed as an observational study rather than a random one. The second problem is that the students are not completely independent since they are from different schools, so there can be many heterogeneous effects due to the differences in the schools. For this reason, it is necessary to develop a way to deal with these heterogeneous effects by schools or cluster.

Here is where this article shows its contribution and its main strength, since the authors develop a model of random forests to be able to treat the student samples by cluster and also how to adapt this model to one that can be used for observational studies, thus solving both the first and the second problem. In addition, it is important to note that the authors of this article provide access to the codes used for this study, which apply all the theory mentioned in the article, which is helpful for those who want to replicate this study or apply it to other data with characteristics similar to those in this article.

A step forward in this type of study, as mentioned in the article itself, would be to show another type of model or models that allow us to face problems of heterogeneity effects and then compare the results of these models to see if there is one that performs better than another and for what cases.
