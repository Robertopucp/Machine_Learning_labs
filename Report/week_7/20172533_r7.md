#### Article: Estimating Treatment Effects with Causal Forests: An Application
#### Author: Susan Athey and Stefan Wager
<p style='text-align: justify;'>The article focuses on how causal forests use estimated propensity scores to be more robust to confounding and how they handle data with clustered errors. To do that, the authors choose The National Study of Learning Mindsets. They want to evaluate the effect of nudge-like intervention designed to instill students with a growth mindset1 on student achievement. To protect the identity of the students, they don't use the actual data, instead they use a simulated data, so the study should be seen as a pilot to the real study (when real data is used).<p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>To build the model, covariates are used, some of them are: Categorical variable for student race, gender, urbanicity of the school, school level achievement, school poverty concentration, among others. The exogenous variable is the treatment, whether or not they receive the "nudge-like" intervention. The endogenous variable and the result to be evaluated is the situation in which the students find themselves after the treatment $Y$ (Post-treatment outcome, a continuous measure of achievement).<p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>Given the proposed model conditions, the authors seek to answer the following questions: Was the mindset intervention effective in improving student achievement ?, Was the effect of the intervention moderated by school level achievement (X2) or pre-existing mindset norms (X1)? and Do other covariates moderate treatment effects?. Although the model is pretty straight forward and easy to understand, there is a few problems or weekness that were presented in the way: there seems to be some selection effects in the synthetic data used here (students with higher probability of success are more likely to take the treatment), and the students in this study are not independently sampled. To solve this last issue, they assume that the outcomes Yi of students within the same school may be arbitrarily correlated within a school (or \ cluster "), and then apply cluster-robust analysis tools.<p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>Given the results,it appears that different schools have very different values of $/tau$ and cannot be explained using covariates, as expected. Two problems have been presented in this setting involved an observational study design with unknown treatment propensities, and clustering of outcomes at the school level. If we properly account for the clustering, we find hints of the presence of treatment heterogeneity, but accurate non-parametric estimation of $ / tau $ (x) is diffcult. In contrast, an analysis that ignores clusters claims to find very strong heterogeneity in $ / tau $ (x) that can accurately be estimated.<p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>As clear and usefull this article has been able to be, it is necessary (as the authors themselves mention) to develop a better understanding of the pros and cons of different aprproaches to heterogeneous treatment effect estimation on clustered data..<p>
