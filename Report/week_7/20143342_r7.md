In this paper, the basis is the application of causal forests on a dataset from the Learning Mindset Study to learn how they use the estimated propensity scores for robustness and how they handle clustered errors. According to the authors, the use of causal forests allows for an algorithmic specification that addresses the design of an observational study with unknown treatment propensities and school-level clustering of results. In the latter mentioned, when accounting for clustering, there were indications of the presence of treatment heterogeneity and accurate nonparametric estimation was difficult. Whereas, by ignoring clustering, more precise estimates can be found even with strong heterogeneity. Thus, we obtained a positive average treatment effect of the intervention, evaluated the treatment heterogeneity, which turned out to be relatively weak, clustered the observations according to the CATE estimates and used the linear predictor method to fit the CATE as a linear function of the causal forestry estimates. Along with this, the effect of pre-existing mindset (X1) and school performance (X2) was checked.

The workshop conducted for the analysis of this paper finds two notable differences: the cluster robustness method and the value of orthogonalization for robustness. In the first case, it is found that it is important to cluster by school, because without doing so, the confidence intervals are reduced, there is unequivocally detectable heterogeneity, the estimates are more dispersed and the sample variance increases by almost 6 points. This can be explained by over-optimism in ignoring the variation of school-specific idiosyncratic effects. For the second case of orthogonalization, it is understood as a not so noticeable result since the estimates do not change with or without orthogonalization. This is explained by the fact that, in this case, confounding factors must also be estimated. If there are some highly predictive characteristics, orthogonalization is more important.

Given the findings, more focus on clustered observations with treatment heterogeneity is recommended to understand the advantages and disadvantages of different modeling of cluster impacts with fixed or random effects.
