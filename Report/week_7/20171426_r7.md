# Report 7: Estimating Treatment Eects with Causal Forests: An Application.
 
 Athey and Wager (2019) analyze a dataset constructed from the National Study of Learning Mindset (NSLM) and aim to answer if the mindset intervention had an effect in improving student achievements, if this effect was controlled by school level achievement or pre-existing mindset norms, or if other covariates moderate treatment effects. They make use of causal forest to solve the two main problems found in the dataset that it is supposedly construted from a random trial: selection effects and that the students are not independently sampled. 

One of the strenghts of this paper is that it shows perfectly when and how to apply causal forest to estimate the true effect of the intervetion or to prove if it was moderated. The explanation of the relationship between the causal forest and random forest, as well as the value of clustering and orthogonalization applied by this methods explains perfectly on why to use it too. Also, as a reader, I think this paper stands out because of the use of code to understand the algorithms. It help not only in following the reasoning descripted in the paper, but also to replicated the procidure. 

Nevertheless, the paper has its own limitations as well. When using a constructed dataset from the generating function of the NSLM, it is assumed that this is the real function and no a biased one since the sample of NSLM could be. Also, this synthetic dataset is the reason we face problems that causal forest solves; however, they probably won't happen in the original dataset and , hence, we will not need this instruments. 

This paper advanced knowledge because it present an informative example on how to apply the causal forest in case it's needed. Not only presents the reason behind this application, but also give us the code to replicate it. Apart from that, the paper could be improved. Maybe, instead of using a synthetic dataset, used one which can be shown by the public and see if this methods are really needed.
