In this paper, Athey and Wager study the application of the causal tree method to analyze heterogeneous treatment effects, using simulated data from the National Study of Learning Mindsets. In doing so, the authors also apply different techniques to correct for problems such as confounding and clusters (in this case schools).

The paper takes an empirical approach. The authors focus on testing how causal forests perform when estimating conditional average treatment effects, in the presence of clusters. This approach helps the authors make a strong case for including clusters, as they show how estimations may vary when those are ignored. They also do a great job in explaining the procedure, and how differents problems during the estimation are addressed. However, as the theory is not the main focus of the paper, some sections are not completely clear. For example, the authors could further explain why they insist on the presence of treatment heterogeneity when it seems weak. 

The main contribution of this paper is the study of how the use of clusters can widely change the estimated effects, not only in the estimated value but also in the confidence interval and variance. As the authors point out, clustering helps to account for idiosyncratic differences between schools, and estimations may vary if left out.

As mentioned in the paper, the next would be to further analyze the use of clustering in the presence of treatment heterogeneity. As the authors point out, in their work, a robust cluster inference comes at a cost of weak treatment heterogeneity. It would be important to know whether this is a widespread phenomenon, and how to solve it.
