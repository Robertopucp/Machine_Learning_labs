## Paper: Athey, S. & Wager,S. (2019) *Estimating Treatment Effects with Causal Forests: An Application*
### Name: Alexander Pacheco (20161901)

The authors apply causal forest to a dataset derived from the National Study of Learning Mindsets. They argue that they do not use the original data in order to protect the student privacy. Thus, they evaluate the impact of teaching students with a grow mindset on student achievement. This is the belief that people can develop intelligence through hard work. Their methodology adress the two challenges presented: selection effects and the fact that the students are not independently sampled. 

The strength of this paper is that the authors use clusters to estimate the model in a more robust way and thus considering the differences that school environment can generate. 

The next steps should be use this methodology in a case with treatment heterogenity and with the real data.
