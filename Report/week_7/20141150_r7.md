<p style='text-align: justify;'> This article aims to make an analysis of the National Study of Learning Mindset dataset using the causal forest method to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects. In this way, this research is an empirical application of the causal forest since the Atlantic Causal Inference Conference was interested in methods for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in observational studies. The National Study of Learning Mindset was a randomized study applied to U.S. public high schools whose purpose was to promote a growth mindset to students. Before using causal forest for estimation, the authors note that the dataset presented two methodological challenges. First, the dataset seems to have some selection bias, for this reason, this research assumes unconfoundness by using instruments to conduct sensitivity for hidden confounding. Second, the students are not independently sampled, instead, they were selected from 76 randomly schools, which generates heterogeneity across schools, so the researchers apply cluster-robust analysis tools to take account of the sample variability of potentially unexplained school-level effects. In this way, the research question is: How does causal forest method handle selection bias (confoundness) and clustered observations to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects?

<p style='text-align: justify;'> One advantage of the article is the order of the development of ideas, as it begins by explaining the adaptation of the cluster-robust tool for random forest and causal forest algorithms. Then, the results of the workshop are explained in response to the questions the researchers asked themselves at the beginning of the research. Finally, the importance of clustering and orthogonality for robustness is highlighted. Another advantage besides the fact that this research can be replicable because the Github repository where the replicable codes are found is shared, also, throughout the research the use of the "grf" package of R which helps to understand the contribution of the article. In few words, the theoretical development of the methodological challenges of the causal forest is complemented by the development of the programming. However, a disadvantage is that some theoretical concepts are not developed, which makes understanding somewhat difficult.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> An important contribution is that the causal forest studies observations are applied, in this way it is possible to observe the methodological challenges that escape from the original development of the causal forest algorithm. In addition, the main contribution is the inclusion of clustering in the estimation of heterogeneous effects using causal forest, despite the fact that the treatment of clustered observations is still an open discussion, since the authors showed the difference in estimating heterogeneous effects when using clusters and when not in use.


<p style='text-align: justify;'> Finally, to continue contributing to the development of the research question, it is necessary to continue studying the clustered observations of dataa set to find better models to estimate the heterogeneous effects. Likewise, it should be noted that the causal forest is not the only method to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects, in that sense, a next step to contribute to the development and empirical application of methods of heterogeneity would be to develop investigations where other methods for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in observational studies can be used.
