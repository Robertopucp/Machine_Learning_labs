Report 7

The work applies the causal forest method to explain in order to evaluate the impact of a growth mindset on student performance. To develop it, it uses simulated data to protect the privacy of students. Taking as reference the National Learning Study. The authors encounter two methodological problems: first, that although the study was carried out randomly, there are selection effects for students with greater intelligence, for which the study is analyzed as an observational study; second, the high heterogeneity between the variables, because as the sample of 76 schools will have differences, for example, idiosyncratic that will affect the causal forests.

The most interesting part of the text is how the causal trees try to explain the aforementioned. For the first question the causal trees find a great result in the averages. However, it is not effective for accurately estimating heterogeneity. In order to achieve this step, they perform an estimate for the level of schools, finding interesting results, but it remains the same for the issue of heterogeneity. Thus, analyzing heterogeneity is a great challenge that can be posed in the future.

The work appropriately uses causal trees for this topic, which, as mentioned at the beginning, is a new topic. Thus, I think this text serves as a preamble to other heterogeneous estimation studies.
