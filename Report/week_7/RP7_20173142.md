## REPORT 7: Estimating Treatment Effects with Causal Forests: An Application

The main question of the research is to answer if the mentality intervention was effective to improve the performance of the students, for this purpose the measurement of the causal effects of the variables used from the database derived from the National Study of Mentalities of learning through the potential outcomes model.

One of the strengths of this research is the different models applied to be able to evaluate the heterogeneity of the treatment. Causal forests are used to study the treatment of heterogeneity. As well as "fixed effects" or "random effects" models are used.
Furthermore, as mentioned by the author, this research faces two challenges, the design of the observational study with unknown treatment propensities and the grouping of school-level results.

However, one of the problems with the methodology used is that students with a higher expectation of success seem to be more likely to receive treatment, which could distort the results of the heterogeneity tests.

Through research, different variables are used in search of finding the presence of heterogeneity. In the first place, it is proposed to use only the school-level variables, which reveals a notable heterogeneity of X1 "pre-existing mentality", that is, schools with higher values ​​of X1 seem to experience greater effects than schools with lower values ​​of X1 . On the contrary, in the case X2 "achievement at school level" there was not much heterogeneity.

Finally, as mentioned by the research author, It would be of considerable interest to develop a better understanding of the pros and cons of different approaches for heterogeneous estimation of treatment effect on pooled data.
