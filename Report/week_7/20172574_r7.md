The question of the paper is whether the strategy of using the causal forest is the right one when clustered errors and confounding problems are present. 

The strength of the paper is that the authors are clear about the problems of their database (clustered observations and selection bias) and the effects it will have on their estimates. Likewise, they specify the assumptions on which they base their work and present alternative works that make other assumptions to solve these problems. Subsequently, it presents the modifications that must be made to be able to make the estimates correctly when facing these problems (clustered observations and selection bias) based on works that have applied these methods. 
However, it should be noted that there is a strong assumption that treatment assignment is as good as random conditionally on covariates and this should be considered before performing a similar estimation.

A contribution of the authors in this topic is that they develop algorithms that allow to check their treatment effect estimation (GRF package). In addition, they present the advantages of using cluster-robust methods, for example, it allows eliminating unambiguously detectable heterogeneity, obtaining a confidence interval for the average treatment effect and unbiased treatment effects. Likewise, the importance of applying orthogonalization for robustness to confounding is emphasized because otherwise we would have biased results such as obtaining treatment effects when they do not exist.

An advance on this topic is to develop research that compares the traditional approach to capture cluster effects via fixed effect or random effect vs. non-parametric models and thus obtain the pros and cons of each approach.
