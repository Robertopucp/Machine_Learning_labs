The authors studies heterogeneous treatment effects of the impact of an intervention in students with a growth mindset to achieve their academic objectives. This, using data of the National Study of Learning Mindsets and, also, using the method of casual forest.

The data used in this study is characterized by using 10,391 observations, in this case each observation is a child, and the probability sample is from 76 schools. For every child thereâ€™s a treatment indicator W_i and an outcome of Y_i. Moreover, they used 10 categorical covariates that represented different characteristics of the school or the child. For instance, some of the variables are categorical variables of ethnicity, gender, generation status, school composition, among others. And the authors tried to answer three main questions: Was the mindset intervention effective in improving student achievement? Was the effect of the intervention moderated by school level achievement or pre-existing norms? Do other covariates moderate treatment effects?

This study presents two challenges and is that they find unknown treatment propensities and cluster problems at school level. This is the reason why they use casual forest to treat these problems. They find that these challenges related to clustering are the most significant ones because when you analyze without taking account of clusters, they find a strong heterogeneity.

In the end, the authors conclude that it is important to use the casual forest method, because, with another more direct machine learning method, the two problems mentioned before will appear. It was important to use cluster-robust methods and orthogonalization to preserve the robustness of the estimation.
