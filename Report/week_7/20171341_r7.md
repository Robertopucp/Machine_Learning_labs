The article wants to answer whether Causal Forests are useful to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects. Authors analyze the National Study of Learning Mindsets which tries to improve students achievement by introducing them to a growth mindset. In his setting is important to ask whether there may be heterogeneous effects derived from the school enviroment. Other problem that arises is that although the Study relies on randomization it seems that there are some characteristics related to propensity to receive treatment. This forces to treat this case as an observational study.

The article is interesting and uses graphical analysis in a suitable way and also includes code lines in addition to the mathematical expression. Nonetheless the article lacks of a more precise explanation of the analyzed program but it is understable since the article focuses to solve the methodological challenges.

To address the analysis, authors first estimate the Clustered Average Treatment Effect (CATE) where they find that the treatment effect was large in average. In the second place authors assess treatment heterogenity where the initially do not find evidence of such heterogenity based  on "omnibus tests" (which are based on the outcome variable). However, when assessing heterogenity based on school variables ($X_1$ and $X_2$) they find plausible evidence of treatment heterogenity. 

In the third place, authors highlight the importance of both clustering and orthogonalization. The importance of school non-observable effects make that conventional treatment effect estimators may guide to wrong conclusions even if we use covariates. On the other hand orthogonalization seems less problematic in this case because confounders are also good predictors of $Y$. Nonetheless, authors mention that in a context where there are variables that predict $Pr(W)$ well but not $Y$, orthogonalization may be necessary.

One step to move forward in discussion would be to analyze other programs where heterogeneous treatment effects may be found. Specially cases where the intervention is on  a group (classrooms, neighborhoods) where we can cluster the sample.
