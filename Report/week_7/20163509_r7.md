<p style='text-align: justify;'>This article arises as a response / motivated by a causal inference conference in 2018. Within this conference, the analysis of the data resulting from the “National Study of Learning Mindsets” was proposed. This can be considered as the objective of this article. On the other hand, the database is randomly collected from secondary schools and is intended to measure the impact on student performance of some intervention measure. The covariates used for the article are entered from this same database. However, the author warns of the presence of a possible bias. This would be evidenced by the fact that students with higher expectations of success are more likely to receive treatment. He also cautions that students are not independently sampled. With this it is generated that there can be many heterogeneous effects. Therefore, to have generalizable results, a solid model must be used. The author uses the “causal forest” method to make the estimates. This is due to the fact that said model can show better results in accordance with the objectives of generalization of the results and the particular characteristics of the database previously explained. The author makes a comparison between the results obtained by causal forest and the special consideration for clusters and orthogonalization compared to a method based on machine learning. Finally, the results that he obtains that the causal forests present allow an algorithmic specification that better addresses the particularities of the base. Likewise, regarding heterogeneity he finds opposite results between the non-parametric estimation and by grouping. Noting the need for a more intense discussion on how to work with pooled observations when modeling treatment heterogeneity.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> The main contributions of this document would be the practical use of an estimation technique not commonly used. In addition, to make the comparison with another method and highlight the differences. The result of warning about further discussion regarding the use of any of the discussed methods is important to open a new line of research. Likewise, he complements the document with the programming codes. This feature makes it stand out because it is not so common for them to be included. It provides in a more didactic and applicable way to convey the focus of the document. It is very orderly in the presentation of the document and presents necessary sections.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Regarding the negative characteristics, it could be mentioned that it is a short text, but with a relatively high mathematical complexity. Likewise, it could not be considered as an introductory document but one that requires more advanced knowledge in statistics, mathematics and programming, to take advantage of the codes.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Finally, the progress of the document, the author mentions precisely this fact in his results, raising a new niche for discussion. Likewise, and based on the results obtained, past published documents could be re-evaluated. In addition, continue with the comparative task with other estimation models. They may possibly show better results.
