# Estimating treatment effect with causal forests: an application  (Athey S. & Wager S.)
### Student: Diego Alonso Gómez (20171738) 

Currently, random forest use has become very popular and useful in academic and profesional research. That due to great advances in computational and statistical matters, which have allowed to use this technique to grant consistent estimations with distint datasets types. However, there could arise some problems when the datasets exhibit a) selection effect bias or b)great heterogeneity across units. 

Therefore, I consider that the authors' research question is the next one: is it possible to use a causal forest method --with a nonparametric method for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation-- with a dataset such as the one provided by "The National Study of Learning Mindsets" to evaluate the impact on student achievement of an intervention designed to instill a growth mindset?

Next, I would say that one of the article's strengths to answer this question are two: a)present and explain the code used in R, which allow the reader to learn how to use the technique in other studies; b)it presents, in an easy-way language, how to make cluster-robust random forest, and then c) how to implement this technique when there seems to ve some selection effects in the dataset to be used. These two last positive statements are resumed in the article final part, where it is mentioned that in the article the authors, in a non-parametric setting, assume an approach that can be interpreted as fitting a functional random effects model:
$$
            Y_i = m_{A_t}(X_i) + W_i\tau_{A_t}(X_i) + \varepsilon_i,  \;\;\;\;  \tau(x)= E[\tau_j(x)]
$$

On the other hand, the weaknesses of the article —from my perspective— is that it does not develop a further explanation of whether an analysis focusing on cluster-level effects is better than a generalizable analysis beyond clusters or not.

That being said, the main contribution of this article —from my perspective— is that it stablish the idea that where each cluster has its own main and treatment effect function, it could widely change the estimated effects, not only in the estimated value but also in the confidence interval and variance of the parameters. 

Finally, important challenges or steps to be addresed in future works would be the following: a) the existance of outcomes' clustering at a level such as school-level highlights the need of a form to determine how to work with clustered observations when trying to model treatment heterogeneity.
