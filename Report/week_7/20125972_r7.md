The authors explain about heterogeneous treatment effect estimation using causal forests based on datasets of National Study of Learning Mindsets in U.S public high schools. The objective of this study was evaluate the impact of a nudge-line intervention designed to instill students with a growth mindset on student achievement. For that we have indicator Wi, it represents receipt of the invervention, Yi which is the post-treatment outcome and 10 other covariates. From these data, the interest of study will try to respond about the effective of this intervention, if some covariates affect the effect of the invervention or another covariates.

To make an answer, the casual forests is important. First, the authors mention the potential outcomes model but the way to resolve has two challenges. By one hand, the National Study have some selection effects in the data used, so that is neccesary to identify causal effects assume the treatment assigment and random continionally on covariates are well. By other hand, the sample of students are not independient, rather happen considerable heterogeneity between schools. It doesn't consider some observations could affect the treatment. One solution could be analize the sample variation's because there are accountable potential effects at schools. For that, Yi can be arbitraily correlated within a school or cluster, after use cluster-robust to make analysis.

Continue with the casual forests, the authors emphasis in clustered observatons, selection bias and discuss how to make random forest cluster-robust in the case of non-parametric regression. They assume all schools have the same weight and generalize the results beyond schools. For that, they estimate a global mean with standard errors. Also, each school has some effect on the student's outcomes. The proccess with the clustered data follow the same steps, so we have one subsample where there are random clusters and another in out-of-bag predictions. About potential correlations in each cluster, only consider an observation i outside of the subsample.

Concerning to heterogeneous treatment effect estimation, the authors consider the propensy score and the expected outcome marginalizing over treatment and build their estimators. Assume these are consistent, independiente and identically distributed, they find the minimium estimator could be use like a objective functon for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation. It is complemented by the R-package grf and adaptive kernel method to re-write the regression forest. So, the procces begin with make a fit by separate in m and e, after make a predictions about out-of-bag and use to grow a casual forest. The parameter that make a fit is the minium.

Finally, related to the questions, the application to function for avarage treatment effect estimation with clusters suggest that the treatment has positive results. About heterogenous treatment, there are two approach to testing, but none has significant estimations, so it is neccesary to discuss the role of cluster-robutness. So that is important to focus in the covariables of X1 and X2, but the results are not clear, incluse use a linear model. Finally, the clustering are important because it helps to know the characteristic that could ommit. It helps to recognize the heterogenous treatment at the regression.
