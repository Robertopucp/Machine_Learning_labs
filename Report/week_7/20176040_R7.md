Title: Estimating Treatment Effects with Causal Forests: An Application
Code: 20176040

This paper presents an application of causal forests to a data set derived from the National Study of Learning Mindsets. This methodology aims to estimate the heterogeneous effects of the treatment, which is a nudge-type intervention designed to instill a growth mindset in students on student achievement. The problem is that there are unobserved school-level characteristics that are important modifiers of the treatment effect; for example, some schools may have leadership teams that implemented the intervention better than others, or they may have a student culture that is more receptive to the treatment.

The authors want their findings to generalize outside the 76 schools in which they conducted the experiment; thus, they conduct an analysis that accounts for sampling variability of potentially unexplained school-level effects. They assume that the Yi scores of students within a single school may be arbitrarily correlated within a school (or "cluster"), and then apply robust cluster analysis tools, which apparently the students in this study are not independently sampled, but all come from 76 randomly selected schools, and there appears to be considerable heterogeneity across schools. This situation could arise if there are unobserved school-level characteristics that are important modifiers of the treatment effect; for example, some schools may have leadership teams that implemented the intervention better than others, or may have a student culture that is more receptive to treatment.

Among the strengths of the paper, considering the structure of the paper, I personally like it very much when they specify the programming tool used and provide the most important codes when they have done their estimation. This allows to replicate and better understand the paper. Also, the explanation of the methodology seemed to me quite important, since, although the methodology has become quite relevant in recent years, it still does not have enough literature, and there are always discrepancies as to its effectiveness. Among the weaknesses, personally, I did not fully understand why the evidence that did not find treatment heterogeneity is not robust, and why only the evidence that focused on X1 and X2 would have more power than the former. I feel as if the authors were forcing their results to their hypothesis. 

The authors begin by discussing how to make random forests robust to clustering in the classical case of nonparametric regression, and give a brief explanation of how forests can be used for treatment effect estimation in observational studies. So, the main contribution of this paper is the use of causal forests as a methodological tool to address two problems the authors had identified: (i) they had an observational study with an unknown treatment propensity, but which was known to be different for each student, and another challenge was (ii) clustering the results at the school level. Then, they found that the use of clustering changes the estimated effects on the outcome variable, both in its value itself, as well as in the confidence interval and variance. For example, in non-causal clustered forests, the sample variance increases and the confidence interval decreases. The authors comment that clustering helps to account for idiosyncratic differences between schools, and estimates may vary if they are omitted.

In particular, they discuss how causal forests use estimated propensity scores to be more robust to confounding, and how they handle data with clustered errors. The results, and the authors themselves, point to the need for further discussion of how to work with clustered observations when modeling treatment heterogeneity.
