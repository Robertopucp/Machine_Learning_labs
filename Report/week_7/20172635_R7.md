In this document, the aim of the authors is to develop a model of causal forests to find a solution to the drawbacks related to the effects of heterogeneous treatment. For this, the causal forests are applied to a data set from the National Study of Learning Mentalities. This one is a randomized study carried out in public schools in the United States; the purpose of this is an impact evaluation, the intervention is related to instilling in students a growth mindset in student achievement

The problems presented by the study are related to methodological challenges, due to the data, there are two challenges and they are the following: the first is that the synthetic data are not completely random, apparently, since they have selection effects. Due to this, the study should be directed with an observational and non-randomized approach, for this an assumption is applied that can be smoothed by an instrument for the assignment of the treatment or a sensitivity analysis. The second drawback is that the study students were not independently sampled, so there may be significant heterogeneity in the samples. Regarding this, it is assumed that the results of the students who are within the same school can be arbitrarily correlated within it.

In this sense, one of the contributions of the authors is the grouping method, since random forests are implemented for the treatment of student samples by cluster, as well as adaptation for observational studies. Based on this, it will be found that when the clusters are ignored a strong heterogeneity is found that can be estimated. Finally, the author points out that it is necessary to delve into the work with grouped observations when heterogeneity is modeled, which could be one of the next steps to investigate.
