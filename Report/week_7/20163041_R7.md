# Title: Estimating treatment effects with Casual Forest: An application

## Names: Morales LÃ³pez Erik Brandon

.  This article is about the causal forest method and use the data from the National Study of learning Mindsets. Firstly is important to understand what exactly is casual forest in statistics. In that sense, the casual forest is based in Machine Learning algorithm (ML) which is clasified as a non supervised learning. Therefore, the causal forest can help us to solve problems related with the clustered observation and the selection bias. In general, this lecture, the researcher explain how we can implement the random forest methods of Machine Learning (ML) when we only know the input data, but not the output data. 

. In that sense, the paper starts explaning the cluster-robust random forest.

Here, the purpose is generalize the results beyond the school in which case is 76. So, it want models more accurate in any student from a new school. The random forests are able to make predictions as an average of "n" trees. For each "n" trees is necesary, we draw a  sub-sample randomly. This is important, because we dont draw a sample of observation, we use the sample of cluster in order to generate a set called "S" and extracting "k" samples of each group. 

. Another point in this article is focused in casual forest for the observation studies. In this case, the casual forest with the *grf* look like as a method based on motivade forest. The important in *grf* with the casual forest start fitting the regression forests by estimating **m** and **e**. Also, the casual forest have many paremeters and they are adjested by the crooss validation. 

In addition, another contribution using the random forest and the clustering method in this study. So, lets talk about the mindsets called **x1** and school-level performance, **x2**. In the first case, we notice that we have more heterogenelity, but not in the school level. However, the heterogenelity occurs in cases where the conglomeration is ignored, but in cases of having them, the opposite occurs.


In summary, the casual forest are applied in order to studies the treatment heterogeneity, although it saw two problems: the clustering outputs and the unknown treatments. All these problems, the level of clustering had a effect in the mindsets analysis. In a analysis with clustering, there is a small presenceof heterogenelity. But in a analysis with non-clustering, there are more heterogenelity than the other. In these cases, we have to consider the pros for the understanding on clustered data as we saw in *x1* and *x2*
