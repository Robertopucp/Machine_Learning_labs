<p style='text-align: justify;'>The following article aims to present an application of the causal forest methodology to estimate treatment effects. For this purpose, it uses simulated data from a model fitted to data from The National Study of Learning Mindsets to evaluate the impact on student achievement of an intervention designed to instill a growth mindset.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>In order to begin the analysis of the study, the authors present a description of the causal forests. While the article applies a particular methodology, understanding what is behind the application complements the learning and understanding of the findings, so explaining this is important even to a limited extent. Likewise, for those who wish to replicate these results, the applied R codes are also shown. Moreover, it explains the methodological challenges of this study and shows how causal forests handle the problems related to clustered observations and selection bias. Furthermore, no strong evidence is found when assessing treatment heterogeneity, as although the estimates of the approaches were consistent on the presence of treatment heterogeneity, none was significant. However, it is interesting that when analyzing heterogeneity in cluster-level variables such as pre-existing mindset (X1) and school performance (X2), a remarkable heterogeneity is found along X1, but not in X2. This situation leads the authors to question whether an analysis focusing on cluster-level effects is better than a generalizable analysis beyond clusters since the estimates change when the presence of clusters is ignored or not.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>The article's contribution is that, through an application of causal forests, it shows how useful causal forests are for estimating treatment effects. Still, it does not ignore the methodological difficulties that can arise when used on clustered data. Therefore, the article emphasizes the need to advance research on how to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects when using clustered data and understand the advantages and disadvantages of each proposed approach.
