This article aims to demonstrate that is possible to solve the problem of inference on low-dimensional parameter $\theta_0$ in the presence of high-dimensional nuisance parameter $\eta_0$. The authors mention that  when using Machine Learning (ML) methods to estimate $\eta_0$ they found that these ML methods perform pretty  well reducing variance and trading off regulation bias with overfitting bias.  Nevertheless, these two bias are very cause a very heavy bias on $\theta_0$ estimation. So the autors found out that it is possible to remove these bias splitting the data through cross-fitting and using Neyman-orthogonal moments. They call this method that make use of tha two ingredients mentioned before Double/Debiased machine learning (DML) and this is the reason for the title of this article too.

One of the strengths of this article is that the autors develop the application of this DML method to carry out inference for differents models like Partially linear regression (PLR) model, average treatment effects (ATEs) and  Local average treatment effects (LATEs).

So the main contribution of this paper is to give this DML method to estaimate and perform inference on $\theta_0$ without the clasical problems when it is used on highly complex settings. It is important to highlight that the authors in this paper show empirical resultsof this method applied in  Pennsylvania Reemployment Bonus experiment and IV estimation by Acemoglu et al. (2001) to estimate the effects of institutions on economic growth.
