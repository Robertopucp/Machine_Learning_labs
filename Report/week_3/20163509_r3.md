<p style='text-align: justify;'> The first chapter of this book has the purpose of bringing the concept of "causality" closer together, through simple examples, and showing the reader that this concept cannot be used so lightly, as if it happens in the everyday environment, within the scientific field. So statistical theory has been relatively silent on this issue. Furthermore, there are large differences between correlation or association.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> A causal statement presupposes that, although a unit was (at a given time) subject to or exposed to a particular action, treatment, or regimen, the same unit could have been exposed to an alternative action, treatment, or regimen (at the same time). Given a unit and a set of actions, we associate each action-unit pair with a potential outcome. These results have the particularity that only one of them is carried out in the last instance and, therefore, it can be observed. The causal effect of one action or treatment in relation to another involves the comparison of these potential outcomes. At this point "the fundamental problem of causal inference" arises. This problem refers to the impossibility of obtaining two potential results from the same unit (physical, natural restrictions, etc.). So, for estimation and inference, we have to compare the observed results of multiple units. In addition, for the estimation, it will also be essential to know or make assumptions about the reason why certain potential results were realized and not others.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>The multi-unit procedure requires that some units in this set be exposed to active treatment and others to alternative treatment. It is important to be clear that time plays a critical role in comparisons and inferences. Therefore, treatment by repeated observation, for the vast majority of research, is not a viable option.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>It is important to mention that the presence of multiple units does not by itself solve the problem of causal inference. Some assumption must be added. The stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) incorporates two ideas: units do not interfere with each other and for each unit there is only a single version of each treatment level. This assumption is usually sufficient but its application will depend on the objectives or type of research, so there are variants. The recognition of the assumptions, when making inferences, is extremely important and its consequences are related to Lord's paradox.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>The second chapter makes a historical review of causal inference (causality): origins, implementation process in research and the most important authors. The most important and influential documents for its development are Neyman (1923) and Fisher (1935). The historical review shows that causal inference, before its formalization and popularization, was used very lightly within the scientific field. Even with Neyman and Fisher there was no clear idea, but hints. It is important to mention the influence of Neyman in Tinbergen, who is considered together with Ragnar Frish as the people who formalized the use of statistical tools as a means to raise models that allow testing economic theories. Likewise, Rubín (1974) should be highlighted, who places the potential results at the center of the analysis of causal effects and discusses the allocation mechanism in terms of potential results.
