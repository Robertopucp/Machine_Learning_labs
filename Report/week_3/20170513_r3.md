In the first two chapters of this book, the authors present the main concepts for understanding causal inference. The main ideas will be summarized in the following paragraphs.

The first main idea is that of potential outcomes. A potential outcome can be defined as the effect of a particular action applied to a unit. Of course, a unit can be exposed to several different actions, hence have several different outcomes. We name all of these possible outcomes as potential outcomes because they havenâ€™t occurred yet; only one potential outcome, the one associated with the action taken, can possibly be observed. This concept is pivotal for causal inference because in order to determine the causality of a certain action we must compare all the potential outcomes. We can only determine causality when we are certain that a certain action led to an outcome, and not taking said action would lead to a different outcome. 

Comparing different potential outcomes comes with a problem: in order to estimate a causal effect, we need to compare the observed outcomes; therefore, we need to consider multiple units and compare their observed effects. To correctly estimate the causal effects when dealing with different units the authors present a second main idea, the Stable Unit Treatment Assumption (SUTVA), which states that (1) the outcomes are not affected by the actions taken over other units (there are no spillover effects), and (2) a unit cannot receive different versions of each treatment.

The authors also propose other important concepts to take into account for doing propper causal inference. For example, one must have an assignment mechanism; this helps us determine which unit receives a certain treatment. Covariates must also be taken into consideration as these characteristics may affect the potential outcome and the assignment mechanism. Finally, the authors discuss the role of randomization in determining causal effects and its relevance for obtaining an unbiased estimation.
