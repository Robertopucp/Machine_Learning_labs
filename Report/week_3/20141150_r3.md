## The Basic Framework & A Brief History of the Potential Outcomes Approach to Causal Inference

## Student: Claudia Vivas Alejando (20141150)

Every day causal language is used informally, we have probably heard phrases like "My headache went away because I took an aspirin", which have causal implications, but possibly not accurate. To learn more about the analysis of causal inference, the authors, in the first chapter, bring us closer to a basic framework for causal inference, where they propose to discuss three key notions: potential outcomes, the Stability Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA), and assignment mechanism. In the second chapter, a historical account is made of the contributions of various academics, such as Jerzey Neyman (1923), Fisher (1925), and Donal Rubin (1974), who allowed the incorporation of the potential outcomes approach to causal inference.

First, the fundamental notion of this chapter and book is that causality is tied to an action (treatment, or manipulation) applied to a unit (an individual person, or collection of objects or persons), in that sense, a potential outcome is the outcome associate with a level of action for each unit and is needed a treatment to refer causality. We talk to these outcomes as potential outcomes since only one outcome will be realized and observed. The causal effect of the treatment implies a comparison of potential outcomes. The latter can be explained through an example. If we go back to the initial causal statement (My headache went away because I took an aspirin) we can establish a unit, I, which has two options, to take or not to take an aspirin to make the headache go away. If he took the aspirin, we would have two potential results "Headache" or "No Headache", likewise, if he did not take the pill there would also be two potential results "Headache" or "No Headache". In this case, the causal effect of the treatment is the comparison of these potential outcomes. Nevertheless, uses only one unit, causal analysis for multiple units would be more enriching.

Second, in multiple units causal effects analysis, the set of units is separated into a group who receive the active treatment and the other is exposed to the alternative treatment (control treatment). In this situation, there are six different comparisons of potential outcomes to determine causal effects. However, the analysis doesn’t end there, is not as simple as it seems because there is no certainty that the treatment applied to one unit does not affect the others, and the effectiveness of the treatment is the same for all units. For these complications is needed to make an important assumption, the Stability Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA). SUTVA is an exclusion restriction that holds two components, no-interference component, assumption that says that treatment applied to one unit should not affect the outcome for other units, and no hidden variations of treatments, that states that the treatment level cannot be different among the units unless the researcher knows of the differences.

Third, it’s necessary to control for the characteristics of the unit, given that with only one of more than one potential outcomes turns out to happened for each unit treated, there’s missing data: “the potential outcome associated with any alternate treatment is missing”, which is solved the use of an assignment mechanism.

Finally, during the 20th century, there was vague talk about the potential outcomes, however, there was no Neyman where this theoretical proposal was formalized through the mathematical notation that he developed, this was his most notable contribution and therefore explicit. Through this contribution, Neyman had two other contributions that were implicit: the stability assumption and the assignment of treatments to units that correspond to the completely randomized experiment. These last two contributions were strengthened and countered by Fisher and Rubin. In 1925, Fisher proposed randomized experiments to determine causal inference. Finally, Rubin (1974) made two key contributions, first, he made potential outcomes relevant in the analysis of causal effects independently of the study is an experimental one or an observational one. And, he introduced the potential outcomes in the assignment mechanism debate.
