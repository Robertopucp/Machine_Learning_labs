<p style='text-align: justify;'> The first chapter presents the basic framework for causal inference, which has three key concepts according to the approach described by the authors. The fundamental notion underlying the approach is that causality is linked to an action (treatment or intervention) applied to a unit (physical object, person, group of objects, or persons at a particular point in time). A causal statement assumes that, although a unit was (at a given time) subject to a particular action, treatment, or regime, the same unit could have been subjected to alternative action, treatment, or regime (at the same time). 

<p style='text-align: justify;'> The first basic concept is that potential outcomes correspond to each action that can be chosen to be applied in reality to a unit. However, they are potential because only one will be the observed outcome since the unchosen actions to be performed will not be observed. Therefore, the causal effect of an action or treatment to others implies comparing the potential outcomes (realized vs. counterfactual). In defining causal effect, there are two essential aspects to consider: (a) the definition of the causal effect depends on potential outcomes but does not depend on the observed outcome and (b) the causal effect is the comparison of potential outcomes, for the same unit, at the same time after treatment, i.e., it is not defined as a comparison of outcomes at different times. Although the definition of causal effects does not require more than one unit, in the estimation of causal effects, multiple units are usually required to make causal inferences because there is only one potential outcome observed per unit. These multiple units can be obtained in different ways: the same object under different treatments at different times or different objects at the same time.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Second, the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) is used because multiple units are required. The SUTVA incorporates the idea that the potential outcomes for any unit do not vary with the treatments assigned to other units (non-interference component) and that, for each unit, there are no different forms of each level of treatment (no hidden treatment variation component). This idea of the SUTVA may be more restrictive if the unit is defined as a community within which individuals interact. Still, it is also an exclusion restriction, which relies on external and significant information to rule out the existence of a causal effect of a particular treatment relative to an alternative. Finally, the assignment mechanism, i.e., how it is determined which units receive which type of treatments (which potential outcomes are realized or not). The assignment mechanism's role in inferring causal effects is important because we may reach invalid conclusions if we do not consider it.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> To estimate the causal effect for any unit, it is usually necessary to predict the potential missing outcome. Comparing the predicted missing outcome with the observed realized outcome allows us to estimate the causal effect at the unit level. However, making predictions of this type can be tedious, so pretreatment variables facilitate this task. One of the main characteristics of these variables is that a priori they are not affected by treatment assignment. The information obtained from these variables can be used to make the estimates more precise by explaining part of the variation in the outcomes or when the researcher is interested in the typical causal effect of the treatment on subgroups defined by the pretreatment variable. These variables are also important because of their effect on the assignment mechanism. Another concept developed in the chapter is causal estimand, which is generally the mean difference of the pair of potential outcomes averaged over the entire population. As well as discussing two generalizations keeping T = {0, 1} for all units, it can be averaged over subpopulations rather than the whole population, which can be defined in different sets of variables or focus on more general functions of the potential outcomes.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> On the other hand, the second chapter details important background on introducing the formal notion of potential outcomes in randomized experiments by Neyman using an urn model to assign treatments to different plots and randomization as the "reasoned basis" for inference by Fisher in the last century. Neyman's contribution was relevant since he proposes an explicit notation of the potential outcomes and an implicit consideration of the SUTVA and a model of assignment of treatments to units as a randomized experiment. However, despite Neyman's contribution, he did not consider physical randomization to evaluate causal effects. In response, Fisher proposed physical randomization between units and developed an inference method based on an assignment mechanism (randomized experiments).
