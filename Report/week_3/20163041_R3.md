# Title: The casual inference

## Names: Morales LÃ³pez Erik Brandon

### Questions about the paper:

1. 

- The chapter 1 from casual inference made by Imbes provides some interesting concepto to evaluate the casual inference such as the object, the potential outcomes, the casual effect, the casual estimate and the SUTVA ("Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption"). All mentioned before can help us to perform best estimate for the casual statistic and understand deeper the effects from the potential outcomes on the certain objects, for example, a person. 

- Firstly, I am going to approach the potential outcomes in which case part of each object and for each level of treatment. In these sense, the potential outcomes is the effect for each object or value on certain set of actions. For example, the pill case from the paper explain how the object can make an effect if I take or not the pill. That action is the potential outcome, but, there is another concept, too. I mean the casual effect that involves comparing the possible potential outcomes. That concept depend from the potential outcomes and the comparing from them. Apart from that, the casual estimate is the diference between the causal efects made by potential outcomes. 

- Secondly, the other important concept that the researcher talked is the SUTVA ("Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption"). This assumption is based on the potential outcomes for any object which dont vary the traetment assigned. The SUTVA can solve the problem of mutiple units cant solve the causal problem. In general, the assumption is only a exclusion for modeling the interaction between objects and range of set of treatment levels in a certain experiment. 


- Finally, the assigment mechanism is used to decide which units can recive any treatment or which potential outcomes are realized or not.
