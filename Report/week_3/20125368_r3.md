Chapter 1 - Causality
The Basic Framework Three fundamental notions are discussed: First, the idea of potential outcomes. Second, the need, when making causal inferences, to observe multiple units, and the usefulness of related stability assumptions, are discussed. Finally, the central role of the allocation mechanism is concerned, which is crucial to infer causal effects. The potential outcomes are the possible scenarios that would have been observed when adopting an alternative action to the real one. In this sense, these potential outcomes cannot be observed since they did not occur. In this sense, causal effects involve the comparison of the observed result with the potential outcomes. Learning about causal effects often requires multiple units, since with a single unit only a single potential result is observed, so multiple units are required to be able to make causal inferences, that is, to have more control units and more units treated. One option is to observe the same unit treated under different levels of treatment at different times. However, it is essential to note that the presence of multiple units does not, by itself, solve the problem of causal inference.
On the other hand, it makes sense to assume that the treated units are not affected by other units. If, for example, the treated unit takes an aspirin, then it is reasonable to consider that another unit will not affect the headache of the treated unit if they are in distant locations.
On the other hand, if they are in the same place, there may be the possibility that said unit might affect the headache status of the treated unit. In this sense, it is crucial to assume the SUTVA, which indicates that: (i) the potential result of a subject is not affected by the exposure of other subjects to the treatment; (ii) the potential results for any unit do not vary with the treatments assigned to other units; and (iii) for each unit, there are no different forms or versions of each level of treatment, which leads to different potential outcomes (Consistency). Once this assumption (SUTVA) has been accepted, then the following can be denoted: for each unit i, in which i takes values from 1 to N, Yiobs is denoted as Yi (0) if Wi = 0 or Yi (1) if Wi = 1, with W being the treatment indicator (1 if taking the treatment and 0 if not). Likewise, for each Yiobs result, there is a missing potential result, which is denoted as Yimis = Yi (1-Wi), which is equal to Yi (1) if Wi = 0 or equal to Yi (0 ) if Wi = 1. However, even so, establishing this notation is not enough to analyze whether or not the treatment had an impact on the treated unit. In this sense, it is necessary to know how each individual received the treatment, which is denoted as the allocation mechanism. Since only one outcome is observed and cannot observed potential outcomes, there is an inferential problem associated with evaluating causal effects or “missing data problem”. In this sense, the missing data mechanism plays a key role or, as it is called in the context of causal inference, the allocation mechanism. That is, how do you determine which units receive which treatments or, equivalently, which potential outcomes are realized and which are not? Therefore, to draw valid causal inferences, one must consider why some units received one treatment rather than another. An example of grounding these concepts is the paper proposed by Abadie et al. (2012). In this research, the authors analyze the tobacco control policy applied to California and not in the other states. For this case, the authors generate a synthetic California, constructed using the synthetic control method, which can be understood, in a simplified way, as a “linear combination” of the other control provinces. In this sense, it seeks to answer what would have happened to tobacco consumption if not applied this California policy. The treated state would be California, and the control states would be the other states selected by the authors. The potential outcome would be the consumption of synthetic tobacco from synthetic California, and the causal effects would be understood as the difference between what happened (real California) and what could have happened (synthetic California). It is essential to mention that, for this research, and specifically, due to the author’s data collection, the alleged SUTVA was accepted. 


Chapter 2: A Brief History of the Potential Outcomes Approach to Causal Inference
This chapter reviews some of these antecedents to put the potential outcomes approach in perspective. The two most important early developments, in quick succession in the 1920s, are the introduction of potential outcomes in randomized experiments by Neyman (Neyman, 1923, translated and reprinted in Neyman, 1990) and the introduction of randomization as the “reasoned basis” for inference by Fisher (Fisher 1935, p. 14). The first such formal mathematical use of the idea of potential outcomes was introduced by Jerzey Neyman (1923), and then only in the context of an urn model for assigning treatments to plots Neyman makes three contributions: (i) explicit notation for potential outcomes, (ii) implicit consideration of something like the stability assumption, and (iii) implicit consideration of a model for the assignment of treatments to units that corresponds to the completely randomized experiment Independent of Neyman’s work, Fisher (1925) proposed the physical randomization of units and developed a distinct method of inference based for this particular class of assignment mechanisms, that is, randomized experiments. On the other side, Rubin (1974, 1975, 1978) makes two key contributions. First, Rubin (1974) puts the potential outcomes center stage in analyzing causal effects, irrespective of whether the study is an experimental one or an observational one. Second, he discusses the assignment mechanism in terms of the potential outcomes. Rubin starts by defining the causal effect at the unit level in terms of the pair of potential outcomes. It fits perfectly with Neyman’s framework for analyzing randomized experiments but shows that the definition has nothing to do with the assignment mechanism: it applies equally to observational studies and randomized experiments. Rubin (1975, 1978) then discusses the benefits of randomization in eliminating systematic differences between treated and control units assignment mechanisms in general mathematical terms as possible depending on the potential outcomes.
