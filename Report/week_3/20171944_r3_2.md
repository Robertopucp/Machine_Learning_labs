### Casualty:The Basic Framework / A Brief History of the Potencial Outcomes Approach to Casual Inferences 
### By: Elizabeth Nicole Linares Camus

### Chapter 1

In chapter one of this book, they talked about three important concepts for casual inference: potential outcomes, SUTVA and assignment mechanism. The first one happens when you can get different results from one unit, these results are called potential outcomes. For instance, they show an example of taken an aspirin, a person is the unit and if the person is suffering from a headache the person can have two choices: take an aspirin and not take the aspirin. These two choices represent the possible potential outcomes from this unit. The second concept is about SUTVA. This is the stable unit treatment value assumption and what it says is that different units don’t interact with each other. In this way, the potential outcome for every unit doesn’t vary with the treatments to other units. This concept is important when you’re working with multiple units. Finally, the third and last concept from this chapter is assignment mechanism, this is the process that defines which unit receive the treatment, in other words, is when you make the decision about what potential outcome is going to happen.

### Chapter 2

In this chapter, the author gives us a historical review of potential outcomes in casual inference. There were two academics that gave us important concepts, the first one is Neyman that was one of the first people who started working with potential outcomes in randomized experiments. The other one is Fisher who started with the physical randomization of units and worked with randomized experiments.
