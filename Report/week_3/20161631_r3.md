# Causality: The Basic Framework

Report 3

In this week's report we read the first two chapters. These two chapters are intrusive, as basic frameworks, for causal inference. In the first chapter, they develop three key notions about causal inference: the first notion is that of potential outcomes; The second notion is the need to observe multiple units, in which they use the SUTVA stability assumption; Finally, there is the allocation mechanism, in which they analyze which units receive which treatment. In chapter 2 it is like an account of the previous literature of some authors. The authors provide a great basis for delving into causal inference. Thus, for people who do not know anything about causal inference it is a good start, because it explains the theory in detail with clear and understandable examples. For example, the definition you make of the effects is quite clear. However, for a person with some knowledge on the subject, these two chapters can become repetitive at some point.


The contribution of this first part is to create a basis for understanding what will be developed in the following chapters. Thus, they manage to make a great contribution to be an introduction. I believe that the main models of causal inference should be developed in the next chapters, because we have a basis for understanding them; also, of a clear literature review that goes from the first thoughts of causal inference to those that began the study of the subject.
