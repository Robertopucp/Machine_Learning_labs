Imbens sets a basic framework for Causal Inference. Causal Inference is important in many fields because it helps researchers to test if  exposuresto certain actions have any  effect. One of the fields that has used causal inference is to answer research questions is Economics.

## Causality

### Potential outcomes
***

When we want to answer a research wuestion related to an exposure we ussually have a $unit$ of study and an $action$ which we. Thus we can define the potential outcome as the possible scenarios that our $unit$  could experience when the $action$ is applied. We therefore can  define a potential outcome as the possible outcome of a pair of a certain $unit-action$ pair. An underlying singularity of potential outcomes is that we will be able to see just one of the potential outcomes at the end of the trial.

### Definition of causal effects

***

A causal effect comes from the comparison of two potential outcomes for one unit. This comparison of potential outcomes derives in the validation or the rejection of an Hypotheis which stands that one  $action$ will have have a certain potential outcome for the unit.


***
### Multiple units 
***

Usually to test the possible effect of an $action$ we need multiple units. This allows us to make causal inference. However the presence of multiple units doesn't guarantee us that we will solve the causal inference problem. There are some assumptions we have to make before trying to make a causal inference

***
### SUTVA
***

SUTVA Stands for **Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption** . SUTVA is an assumption that says that the potential outcome of any unit won't vary with the treatments assigned to other units. In some scenarios we cannot expect this assumption to be complied because of the presence of spillovers. 

As mentioned above in some cases, SUTVA is no longer a valid assumption. However there's solutions for this case. For example, SUTVA can be applied when evaluating subgroups of people (ie. from students to classrooms).

***
### Assignment mechanism
***

Since we cannot see every potential outcome but just one potential outcome for each unit we have to be sure that the effect we have measured can be taken as a causal one. A key role of this is therefore played by the assignment of the treatment. It has to be clear what determines the assignment to  the treatment or control grpup.

In this context , it is useful to consider  attributes of the units before one group of them receive the treatment. Why? There are three main reasons: (i) first, it will help us to capture some variation on the outcome variable, (ii) second, it will help us to answer specific questions for some groups (youngre vs older, male vs female), and (iii) last but not leas, those attributes can have an effect on treatment assignment (focalized social programs).

## Potential outcomes approach to causal inference
***

This approach is relatively recent and has been initially applied to just randomized experiments. However thsi approach is now also aplied to observation studies. Neyman, Fisher and Rubin established the basis of potential outcomes approach. Their inputs have provided an theoretical framework which is the basis of the potential outcomes approach to causal inference.

Nowadays, potential outcome approach  is used in either randomized and observational studies to answer queastions  about causality.
