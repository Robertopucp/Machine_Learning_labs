# Causality: The Basic Framework & A Brief History of the Potential Outcomes Approach to Causal Inference

### Chapter 1:  The Basic Framework
The first and second chapter of the book provides us with an introductory framework to study causal inference by provinding preliminary concepts, as well as a short recapitulation of the changes in the concepts and introductions of assumptions needed.

The first chapter presents us three esential concepts to understand causal inference. Potential outcome is defined as the outcome of an level of action (treatment) for each unit, as it is needed an action to talk about causality. With this, we can define the causal effect of the treatment or active action as the comparison between the two potential outcomes of the same unit at the same time (especifically, the post-treatment time). Although we see at most half of this outcomes since we cannot see the unit in both scenarios (with treatment or without treatment), the causal effect can depends can be estimated using the observed (potential) outcomes and multiple units.

The use of the latter one implies complications that can be interviene if needed by the The Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption, or SUTVA. It holds two main components: the no-inference one, that is related to the fact that the treatment of one unit shouldn't affect the results of another one; and the no-hidden-treatments, that holds that a unit exposed to a treatment level should have a defined outcome.However, we can use alternative approaches to SUTVA as is only a candidate exclusion restriction. 

Nevertheless, since we are dealing with multiple units, we need to place some of them into the control or treated group to solve the missing data problem: the potential outcome of a different level of the treatment is not observable. To do this, we use the assignment mechanism as it regulates which unit are selected into those. All along, we can finally define the causal estimands, that can be estimated for differente subgroups of our group of interest. This concepts are introduced intuitively to the reader. Particularly, I enjoyed the use of the "informal" causal inference applied by us in our normal life to undestand what potential outcomes are. 

### Chapter 2:  A Brief History of the Potential Outcomes Approach to Causal Inference
The second chapter introduces us the contributions from Neyman, Fisher, Rubin, among others, to the construction of what we know now about causal inference. Before Neyman, we cannot really find a formal notation fot "potential outcomes" far away from semi philosophical ideas from Mill in the early 70s. By introducing an urn model for assigning treatment (varieties) to plots and presentir the idea of the "true" yield (of a variety) as the average of the potential yields of the same variety in all the plots; Neyman contributes with the formal notation, the implicit presentation of the stability assumption and implicit presentation of a model for the assignment of treatments to unit (such as a randomized experiment). A

After history ignored Peirce, Fisher explicited randomization as a condition to determine causal effects and introduced what we know as randomized experiment. Yet, social scienses adopted other approach in which associations between observed values of the outcome variable and covariates were used to infer causality, until recently. The evolution of what we know as "causal inference" allows to appreciated how it not only a relative early investigation area, but also how it also under construction.
