In this chapter, three subjects about casual inference are discussed: the potential outcomes, the necessity of multiple units, and the role of the assignment mechanism.   

First, causality is tied to an action applied to a unit. This unit can be a physical object, a person, a group of persons, or objects, all of this in a certain moment in time. Given these, then we associate each action-unit pair with a potential outcome. In the end, it is expected that the potential outcome will correspond to the action that was previously taken. Thus, within these potential outcomes, only one will be realized and this latter will lead to its observation. On the other hand, the other potential outcomes won’t be observed as far as the corresponding actions that would lead to them were not executed. In this context, the causal effect of one action relative to another involves the comparison of these potential outcomes, for the same unit, in which one is realized and the others are not realized then not observable, this is at the same moment in the post-treatment effect.   

Secondly, learning about causal effects requires multiple units to observe different expected results: some exposed to the active treatment, and other units exposed to the control treatment. As time matters in this study, what this topic proposes is to observe the same (different) physical objects repeatedly approximately at the same time. 
When working with multiple units, it is worth it to assume that treatments applied to one unit do not affect the outcome for another unit. To do so, there is a list of assumptions to take into account. Those are englobing into *The stable unit treatment value assumption* (**SUTVA**), which incorporates the idea that units do not interfere with one another and the concept that for each unit there is only a single version of each treatment level.  
- Component 1: The potential outcomes for any unit do not vary with the treatments assigned to other units, and, for each unit, there are no different forms or versions of each treatment level, which lead to different potential outcomes.  

- Component 2: This one states that an individual receiving a specific treatment level cannot receive different forms of that treatment. In consequence, SUTVA is only one candidate exclusion restriction for modeling the potentially complex interactions between units and the entire set of treatment levels in a particular experiment  

Thirdly, causal effects are defined by comparing potential outcomes but we can only observe at most half of all potential outcomes, and none of the unit-level causal effects. Therefore, there is an inferential problem associated with assessing causal effects: a missing data problem. In this latter, given any treatment assigned to an individual unit, the potential outcome associated with any alternative treatment is missing. In this case, we tend to play with the assignment mechanism.
