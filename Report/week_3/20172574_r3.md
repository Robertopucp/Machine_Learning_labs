#### CHAPTER 1 Causality: The Basic Framework

The first chapter introduces three basic concepts of causal inference: potential outcomes, SUTVA, and assignment mechanics.


Potential outcome is defined as the outcome of a level of action for each unit and is observable only ex-post. In addition, it also tells us about the causal effect because it is observed by comparing the potential outcomes of two groups. Causality implies an action performed on a unit (person, object, etc.), where an active action is called active treatment and a more passive one called control treatment and for each case there is a potential outcome.


The stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA)
When analyzing causal effect, it is necessary to make assumptions in order to correctly evaluate the potential outcome and these assumptions are SUTVA which tells us that the action on one unit does not affect the outcome of another and that for each unit there is only one single version of treatment level.


Finally, when we must compare the different potential outcomes of different units, we must solve the problem of what level they are at when facing the treatment (covariate) and why that type of treatment is applied, this is solved by the assignment mechanism which allows assignment by subgroups.




### CHAPTER 2 A Brief History of the Potential Outcomes Approach to Causal Inference

This chapter presents contributions from different authors that served as a basis for the study of casual inference. Neyman(1923) was a pioneer in the description of casual inference and contributed the explicit notation for potential outocmes, the basis of SUTVA and a model for the assignment of theatme to units. Subsequently, authors such as Fisher (1925) expanded the field of casual inference by implementing randomize treatments to units. Finally, we present studies where potential outcomes have been used, Tinbergen(1939), Haavelmo(1944) and studies where the assignment mechanism Rubin (1974,1975,1978) were incorporated.
