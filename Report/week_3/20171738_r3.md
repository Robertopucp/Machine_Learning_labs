## Report 3 : Causal Inference for Statistics, Social, and Biomedical Sciences: An Introduction.

From my point of view, these two chapters have the main objective to set out the basic framework for causal inference introduction with a non-complicated language to explain abstract statistic concepts. That been said, we can continue.

So, the first chapter introduced the basic concepts for understanding causal inference. Something that is mentioned that I consider important to mention is that there are two important aspects of this definition of a causal effect. First, the definition of the causal effect depends on the potential outcomes, but it does not depend on which outcome is actually observed; and second, that in an ideal world the causal effect is the comparison of potential outcomes, for the same unit, at the same moment in time post-treatment.

Sadly, as is it also mentioned in the chapter, a priori exists what is known as “The fundamental problem of causal inference”, which basically is that, for any individual unit, we can observe only one of Y(1) or Y(0), as indicated by W; that is, we observe the value of the potential outcome under only one of the possible treatments, namely the treatment actually assigned, and the potential outcome under the other treatment is missing. Thus, inference for causal effects is a missing-data problem: the “other” value is missing.

Therefore, considering that problem, the author mentions the necessity of assumptions of stable unit treatment value (STUVA). This assumptions have two elements that seek the stability of the treatment of the different units. The first element is the non-interference component, and the second one is the non-hidden treatment variation: this assumption requires that the treatment does not vary from one unit to another.


Finally, the second chapter is an historical review to show the reader how the techniques and approaches related to causal inference have developed through the years. With that in mind, the chapter begins mentioning that the term “potential outcome” was formally introduced in 1923 by Neyman for an exclusive use in the context of randomized experiments. Then the chapter ends by showing us how Rubin defined the causal effect at the unit level in terms of the pair ofpotential outcome, which meant an introduction of the relation of potential outcomes and assignment mechanism in 1974, for wich I consider that He should be highlighted because he places the potential results at the center of the causal effect's analysis.
