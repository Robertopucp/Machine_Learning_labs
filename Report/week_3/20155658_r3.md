<p> Nowadays, Statistics has become an important tool in the research processes, since it allows planning the research, collecting, organizing, representing, interpreting and analyzing the information regarding individuals or observations of a phenomenon being studied: common characteristic, in a population or in a sample. The analysis allows describing information behaviors, drawing conclusions and giving recommendations for decision-making. For this, the so-called causal inference has been used for quite a few decades. It has already had interference in many areas of the medical, social, psychological, economic sciences, etc. In this sense, Guido W. Imbens and Donald B. Rubin in their book "Causal Inference for Statistics, Social, and Biomedical Sciences: An Introduction" provide us with a tool to introduce us to understand Causal Inference. Next, I am going to write a brief summary of chapters 1 and 2 of that book.</p>

<p>In this first chapter, three basic concepts are presented in the framework for causal inference.</p>

<p>The first concept is that of potential outcomes, one for each unit for each level of treatment. Potential outcomes are defined as the effect of one variable on another. That is, a variable (let's call it X) had an intervention, an action on another (let's call it Y). And what in theory is done is to calculate - through an estimation- the magnitude of that effect. Such causal estimates are defined in terms of these potential outcomes, possibly also involving treatment assignments (choosing your control group correctly) and pretreatment variables (how your pretreatment variables are doing).</p>

<p>The second concept that is discussed is that, because -at most- only one of the potential outcomes can be observed, it is necessary to observe multiple units in order to make causal inferences. To exploit the presence of multiple units, we use the stability assumption, SUTVA, which is the second basic concept in the theoretical framework. The stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) incorporates the idea that the units do not interfere with each other. What we would say in econometrics, there is a high correlation between variables, since it would skew the regression. It also incorporates the concept that for each variable only the treatment is applied and no other.</p>

<p>The third fundamental concept is that of the assignment mechanism, which determines which units receive the treatment. Since we will only have visible -observable data- half of the total results, it is important to properly choose the units as a control and treatment group. This to have the best estimator in terms of causal results.</p>

<p>In the second chapter, we will see the main antecedents for the potential results approach.</p>

<p>One of the main antecedents is Neyman's randomized experiments. Neyman introduces what he calls "potential return" through the formula:</p>

$ a_{i} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=1}^{m} U_{ik}$

$U_{ik}$: potential yield

$i = 1,...,v $, where $i$ indexes the variety

$k = 1,...,m $, where $k$ indexes the plot

$ a_{i}$ : the best estimate of true yield

<p>Neyman's contributions were -through this equation-: 
(i) explicit notation for the potential outcomes, 
(ii) implicit consideration of something like the stability assumption, and 
(iii) granting the unit treatment assignment mechanism to approach a randomized experiment.</p>

<p>Another of the main antecedents was the introduction of randomization as the "reasoned basis" for the inference by Fisher. Fisher proposed physical randomization of units and, furthermore, developed a different method of inference based on this special class of allocation mechanisms, that is, randomized experiments. The random assignments can be made, for example, by choosing balls from an urn.</p>
