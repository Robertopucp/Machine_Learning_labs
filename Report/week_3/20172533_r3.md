## Causal Inference for Statistics, Social, and Biomedical Sciences: An Introduction.
## Author: Guido W. Imbens and Donald B. Rubin. 
<p style='text-align: justify;'> The two first chapters of this book take care of the introduction to causal inference. Something that is important to highlight before we get in the content of the book, is the use of a simple language and easy going examples to explain relative complex topics in the statistic. This make the book begginer friendly, introducing each concept in an interactive and easy understanding way.<p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'> The first chapter introduced the basic concepts for understanding causal inference. One detail to keep in mind is that correlation or association (which has been studied for a long time, especially in old statistics) is not the same as causality. Causality is the phenomenon linked to an action applied to a unit. The correct way of evalue the consequence of the action is to have more than one unit, where an active treatment can be tested against a control treatment, each of each pair of action units with a potential outcome.  The cause-effect of each of the actions (whether active or control) is conditioned to the comparison of the possible results.<p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>To define causality, multiple assumptions must be made, specifically the assumptions of stable unit treatment value (STUVA). STUVA assumptions have two elements that seek the stability of the treatment of the different units. The first element is the non-interference component, this assumption requires that the treatment applied to one unit does not affect the possible result of another unit. The second element is the non-hidden treatment variation, this assumption requires that the treatment does not vary from one unit to another.<p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>This assumptions need to be functions well defined (both for the units and for the treatment), this will give us potential reliable outcomes as a result. Although SUTVA is not a viable alternative for complex interactions, for the vast majority of cases it is.<p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>Accepting the above assumptions, it is important to take into account the assesing mechanism, the way in which each individual actually received the treatment. However, in this first part of the book this content is not explained further. <p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>One of the most important problems associated with the evaluation of causal effects is explained because we can only observe half of the potential results, this specific problem is called a missing data problem.Associated with this, to find the causal effect of any particular unit we need to predict the missing outcome (the outcome in which one the treatment is not given). For this, the covariates are of vital importance, they serve to make more precise estimates, in addition this information can have effects on the assigment mechanism and consequently on the possible outcomes.<p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'> All the points and concepts previously exposed have a single objective, the causal estimand. The causal estimate is the average difference of the pair of potential outcomes, averaged over the entire population.<p>
