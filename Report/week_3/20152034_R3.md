## Potential outcomes

" No causation without manipulation "

The first is to understand that causality is linked to an action by applying it to a unit. Taking into account these actions we can call active treatments or control treatment and the treatment result (action) is associated with a potential result. They are potential because only one of the many that could be observed was made. Be clear about the timing of the action must take place before a potential result. The affirmations or conceptual constructions to formulate causality must formulate a counterfactual state and a precise intervention. An example can be given in two levels of treatment taking or not taking aspirin and the possible result would be improved due to aspirin. The result depends on the action to be taken. The definition of causal effects implies that being a unit and only once the causal effect can be defined but its value cannot be learned only with a potential result. For this reason, the estimation of causal effects needs to repeatedly compare the potential results for various units. To estimate we must also think about the allocation mechanism for that unit and the causal estimate.

## Multiple Learning Units

Multiple units should be relied upon for causal inferences by exposing them to active treatment or control repeatedly, although the fact that it is a guess should not be lost sight of. In many situations it may be reasonable to assume that treatments applied to one unit do not affect the outcome of another unit.

## SUTVA 


" The potential outcomes for any unir do not vary with the treatments assigned to other units, and, for each unit, there are no different forms or versions of each treatment level, which lead to different potential outcomes. "

It is the assumption of stability that is used to dynamize the presence of multiple units to be able to make causal inferences. The stable unit treatment value assumption incorporates both this idea that units do not interere with one another and the concept that for each unit ther is a only single version of tratment level. In the case of aspirin do not take a two aspirin with diferent efficacy. The elements of the assumption of SUTVA enable estimating causal effects with multilpe units.  

The presence of no interference assumption of the the treatment in the one unit do not affect in the result of the other unit. This element is for credible with a separate experiment of designed control or designed treates. In specific case SUTVA requiere other complements or in a huge poblation is different. The other elemt is again an exlusion restriction the requeriment is that the label of the aspirin tablet or the nature of the administration of the treatment cannot alter the potential outcome for any unit. For that we need combined any inference with careful study design. 

## THE ASSIGMENT MECHANISM 

 The potential results can be 0 or 1 dependes of the treatment level, but define causal inference the accion for the treatment requires a details in the study. The assigment mechanism enable realte the potential result with treatment. We cannot simply look at the observed values of potential outocmes under differetns treatment and reach valid causal inferences irrespective of the assigment mechanism.

Background

---

The most important antecednts in quixk succession in the 1920s are the introduction od potential outcomes in randomized experiments by Neyman an the introduction of randomized as the reasones baiss for inference by fisher in 1935. The concept of potential outcomes was used exlusive ib randomized experiments and not in observational studies. Donal Rubir in 1974 use the lenguage but long time later it found a widespread acceptance.
