# Report 3:
## Cap 1 Casuality: The Basic Framework & Cap 2: A Brief History of the Potential Outcomes Approach to Causal Inference
### Guido W. Imbens and Donal B. Rubin

This report is going to talk about causal inference, which is developed in the first and second chapters. Beginning with the introduction of causal inference, it explains from the examples that we consider casual effect in a easy way, but behind of that has more things to considered, it is neccesary to make note that the correlation is different to causality. This is relative to action respect of one thing (people or objects). Many actions can depends of one unit and many potential outcomes, but only one will be realized and observed throught the comparassion between the many possibilities at the same post-treatment effect. The authors refers that like "because". 

It's important to consider the next assumptions: Stable unit treatment value (STUVA), where we find two elements, the first one is the non-interference component and the second is the non-hidden treatment variation. In the first case, the treatment is focus in one unit can't affect the possible result of another unit. The last case, the treatment doesn't vary from one unit to another. 

We find problems like seeing the half of the potential results: missing datas. This is a difficulty to make comparassions between many potential outcomes, because we need to predict the missing results, so the covariance are important, they give us better estimation.
