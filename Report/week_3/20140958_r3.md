We read the first and second chapters *Causality: The Basic Framework* presents the fundamental notions to evaluate causality. This report will summarize the main ideas of these chapters in the following lines.

The first chapter starts revealing the fundamental notions in causality: (i) a *unit*, which can be a physical object, a firm, an individual person, or collection of objects or persons at a particular point in time; (ii) the *potential outcomes*; (iii) the SUTVA assumptions; (iv) the assignment mechanism; (v) the causal estimands, defined in terms of the *potential outcomes*; (vi) pre-treatment variables (or covariates).First of all, to talk about causality, an *action* or treatment is needed. The *potential outcome* is defined as the outcome of a *action* (treatment) level for each *unit*. Considering these concepts, we can determine the causal effect of the treatment or *active action* as the comparison between the two potential outcomes of the same unit (at the same point of the time, precisely the post-treatment time). However, we cannot observe the same unit in both scenarios (with treatment and without treatment). For instance, suppose that that person takes an aspirin. We can observe what happened at this level of treatment, but we need to create a counterfactual to another level of treatment (i.e., when the same person doesn't take aspirin). As it is impossible, it means we can't see the counterfactual for that unit. 

Therefore, it is necessary to have multiple units to evaluate the causal effect. Having multiple units will help to observe if there are *units* in which the potential outcomes differ. However, there are two main problems when dealing with multiple units. The first problem is that the decision of one *unit* could affect the treatment (or decision) of the other one. The second problem is that there could be different versions for each treatment level. It could affect the conclusion of our causal relation. At this point, the *stable unit treatment value assumption* (SUTVA) notion arises. There are two components in the SUTVA assumption that refer to these problems. The first one refers to the fact that the treatment to one unit doesn't affect the other units. The second one requires that an individual receiving a specific treatment level cannot receive different forms of that treatment. In that sense, if SUTVA is fulfilled, it will allow us to make our causal inference with multiple *units*. Another aspect to consider when applying treatment is the *assignment mechanism*, that is to say, how each individual came to receive the treatment level received. How is it determined which units get which treatments or, equivalently, which potential outcomes are realized and which are not? In this context, we can use covariates that must be a priori known to be unaffected by the treatment assignment (does not correlate with the treatment). In fact, using covariates can help us make estimates more precise by explaining some of the variations in outcomes.

The second chapter reviews some parts of the history of the causal inference and how some terms were taken from statistics. For example, it presents the *potential outcome* introduced by Neyman (1923). However, *potential outcome* uniquely applied it in the context of randomized experiments. Another critical author is Fisher (1935). Fischer conditioned the causal inference to randomization. However, because of ethics or time restrictions, randomization cannot be deployed some studies in the social sciences with randomization alone. What we know nowadays as *causal inference* is a contemporary sophistication of the area. It implies that it is still in construction.
