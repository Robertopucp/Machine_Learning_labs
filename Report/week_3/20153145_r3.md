These chapters, respectively, give a particular modern analysis and the history of the analysis of causal effects. The first chapter presents schematically 03 fundamental concepts regarding the analysis of causal effects, namely the concepts of a) potential outcomes, b) the Stability Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA), c) the assignment mechanism. Among these concepts, it’s the former which stablishes itself as the cornerstone to the approach presented in this paper. The second chapter mentions how the potential outcome approach was developed and then spread out, as well as how this term linked to assignment mechanisms. The following, for the chapter 01, is a more detailed explanation of each of these concepts and their concatenation with each other, while, for the chapter two, such more detailed explanation will match the distinct segments of causal analysis history with the main authors whose contributions gave central importance to the concept of potential outcome and how the expansion of its use in causal effects analysis got beyond its initial analytical field, in conjunction with the assignment mechanism emergence as a necessary tool into this analysis.
The chapter 01 presents the 03 fundamental concepts of the causality framework already mentioned, which cornerstone is the term potential outcomes, being the first of these concepts presented. In order to present these 03 concepts, the authors schematize a scenario in which there’s a unit (or a group of units) that receive(s) a certain treatment/action, out of a range of possible treatments, and experience(s) one of a range of possible outcomes, which are catalogued as potential outcomes. The reason for its name is due to the fact that only one of these possible outcomes will effectively occur for each unit that receives a treatment. In addition to this specification, because while pretending to estimate causal effects it’s only possible to observe only one of the potential outcomes for the treatment received by one unit and this leads to the need of comparing more than one unit, the authors highlight the relevance of delimitating the set of possible treatments and the assignment of those treatments to units, controlling for their characteristics before receiving the treatments. On the one hand, such delimitation of possible treatments has to take into account that b.i) there’s no interference of the treatment one unit receives in relation to the treatment other unit receives, and b.ii) there’s no hidden variation the treatments/actions applicable to each unit. These two conditions constitute the assumptions that the values of treatments for each unit are stable or, more succinctly, the Stable Unit Treatment Value Asssumption (SUTVA), which is the second fundamental concept presented in this causality framework. On the other hand, it’s necessary to control for the characteristics of the unit, given that with only one of more than one potential outcomes turns out to happened for each unit treated, there’s missing data, which is solved the use of an assignment mechanism. This assignment mechanism is a mechanism that equates certain characteristics of the subgroup that will receive a certain treatment of interest and the other subgroup not receiving such treatment/manipulation. Those characteristics have to be independent of any particular treatment, so it allows to recreate two similar groups that conform a good basis for rigorous comparison, since this will assure that both groups are in a similar state before the particular treatment each one receives and therefore there’s no bias in the conclusion one can extract from the comparison of both groups’ post-treatment outcome.
