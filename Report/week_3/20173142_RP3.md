# Report 3- Causal Inference for Statistics, Social, and Biomedical Sciences: An Introduction

# Causality: The Basic Framework

I will focus on chapter 1, which I consider most important. In this chapter the book focuses on describing 3 basic concepts. The first concept is the notion of potential outcomes. The second concept is causal effects in multiple units. Finally, the concept of assignment mechanism is discussed.

With regard to the first concept, it refers to the levels of treatment or handling. A unit may have been exposed to a particular action, treatment or regimen, the same unit could have been exposed to an alternative action, treatment or regimen. Given a unit and a set of actions, we associate each action unit pair with a potential outcome. We refer to these outcomes as potential outcomes because ultimately only one will be realized and therefore possibly observed: the potential outcome corresponding to the action performed.

In relation to the second concept, while although it's true that with a single unit we can observe at most a single potential outcome, it is therefore necessary to use multiple units in order to make multiple causal inferences. However, the presence of multiple units alone does not solve the problem of causal inference which indicates that the presence of multiple units may interfere with the correct performance of the other units.
In order to solve the problems presented by multiple units, assumptions such as SUTVA, which indicates that the units do not interfere with each other, are used to avoid the concept that for each unit there is only a single version of each level of treatment.

Finally, assignment mechanisms refer to how each individual came to receive the assigned level of treatment. This mechanism serves to draw valid causal inferences, so that we can consider why some units received one treatment rather than another. Furthermore, it's necessary to mention that in the case of classical randomized experiments, the assignment mechanism is under the control of the experimenter, and the probability of any assignment of treatments among the units in the experiment can be fully known before the experiment begins. However, in the case of regular assignment mechanisms, this isn't necessarily under the control of the experimenter, and knowledge of the assignment probabilities is incomplete in a very specific and limited way.
