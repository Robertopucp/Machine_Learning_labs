## Chapter 1

This first chapter submits three key notions for understanding the authors' basic framework approach for casual inference. 

The first concept is about the potential outcome. These are defined as the outcome of a unit that was subjected to a treatment or not. Thus, the casual effect of a treatment is the difference between these two potential outcomes at the same point of time (with treatment and no treatment). However, a problem arises when we realize that one of the potential outcomes cannot be observed. For estimation of casual inference, comparisons of potential observed outcomes are needed. To do this, we first need to make assumptions and think about the assignment mechanism.

The second one is about the assumptions that the treatment of one unit do not affect the potential outcome of another one and the idea that for each unit there is one single version of each treatment level. These assumptions are known as the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA).

The third concept is about the assignment mechanims. It is needed to know which unit should be in the control o treated group. These groups are formed to deal with the missing data problem. This last one is the problem described in the first paragraph. 

## Chapter 2

This chapter is about the contributions that different authors have made to the casual inference literature. For example, Neyman's main contributions is the mathematical formalization of a notation for potential outcomes. Another example is Fisher, who determined that randomization is a fundamental condition for casual inference.
