The first chapter of the book have the objetive of establish the basic framework for causal inference, so to do it the autor expands on the 3 underlying notions: potential outcomes, multiple units and stability as assumptions related to these and the role of the assignment mechanism. 
To can explain about potencial outcomes, First, it is necessary to point out that for this document are considered two actions for environments, where the first action is active treatment or only the treatment and the second action is control. Taking into account the above, the potential results are defined as the effect of the actions on a unit/environment. It means that to each unit with the two actiones will exist, in the last of the cases, a potencial outcome and this because only can be observed which is related to the action taken.
The second discussion is related to the existing assumption that the applied treatments do not affect the result of another unit, this because in order to make causal inferences, multiple units are required. Then the assumption of stable unit treatment value (SUTVA) is applied, which, basically, says that the potential results for any unit do not change with the treatments to other units and for each unit there are no different versions of the treatment levels, this will give different potential results.
Finally, the rol of the assignment is the last discussion of the first chapter. Here will be determinate which units receive the treatment. This has a fundamental role for causal inference, so in later chapters the author expands on problems related to this mechanism.
In the second chapter, a literature review of causal inference is made where the focus of potential results is put into perspective. The author mentions that for this the first two most important developments are those of Neyman (1923) and Fisher (1935); however, at our own discretion, the section to be highlighted will be the Early Uses of Potential Results in Observational Studies in Social Science.
Although there was no generalized notation on the potential results, frameworks for causal inference were made that are similar to those currently proposed. The use of potential results is used in the analysis of supply and demand functions, as well as for the models of simultaneous equations in general economics with authors such as Tingergen (1930) and Haavelmo (1994). The domain of this framework of causal results is owned by economics and other social scientists, which is why I chose this section.
