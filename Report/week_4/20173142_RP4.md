# Report 4- The Double-Lasso Method for Principled Variable Selection

The main proupose of this paper is describe a double lasso method that can help researchers select variables for inclusion in analyses in a principled manner that avoids inflated Type I errors.Furthermore, in order to overcome such biases,the author recommed use the “double-lasso” variable selection procedure, this method has three steps.

First, fit a lasso regression predicting the dependent variable, and keeping track of the variables with non-zero estimated coefficients. Second, fit a lasso regression predicting the focal independent variable, keeping track of the variables with non-zero estimated coefficients.
Finally, fit a linear regression of the dependent variable on the focal independent variable, including the covariates selected in either of the first two steps.

One of the strengths of this paper is that the autor proposed a method to try to identify which covariates have sufficient empirical support for inclusion in  analyses of correlations, moderation, mediation and experimental interventions, as well as to test for the effectiveness of randomizatio. Furthermore, this method proposed by the author is supported by empirical evaluations which reinforce the main objective of the author.

Finally, the author, with this double lasso method, contributes to the prevention of covariate selection problems in correlation analysis, and this approach proves us an empirical basis for determining which variables to think hard about.
