<p style='text-align: justify;'> In the following article the author seeks to provide an estimation method that allows us to tackle the problem of the selection of covariates. This question is extremely important, as selecting potentially spurious or unnecessary covariates can result in biased or weak parameter estimates. The Lasso estimation method allowed us to reduce the number of covariates, but this process could have different problems. The main one was due to the coefficient reduction to zero of important variables. However, the Double-Lasso model is presented as an alternative that allows us to overcome this problem. This model is calibrated for the double lasso method and is calibrated not to over-select potentially spurious covariates. In addition, as a check, the author presents the double Lasso results and compares them with other methods in four different sets. It is found that the double Lasso has favorable results (lower reported error and higher statistical power in the estimators) than other methods. However, it is important to mention that the covariates that are selected by means of the double Lasso, have empirical support, could lack theoretical support and, therefore, interpretive problems.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> The main contribution of this article is the presentation and conclusions about the double Lasso model to address the problem of selection of covariates. Also, it is important to mention that the article provides a code appendix and mathematical demonstrations about the model. These contributions are extremely important to build the theoretical framework or make estimates in future research. Likewise, it focuses on the application of the method and the interpretation of the results. Therefore, he performs various application examples and presents the results in a simple way (very understandable for the reader).

<p style='text-align: justify;'>The next steps to advance the question in this article would be to address the main problem of the double Lasso model. Also, it would be interesting to expand to panel type data and continue contributing code.
