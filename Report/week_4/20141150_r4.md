<p style='text-align: justify;'> The goal of the paper is to introduce thoroughly double-lasso regression as a principle method for variable selection. This method is used to know whether to control for covariates and how to select which covariates to include. Moreover, it’s mentioned in this paper that there are two effects of failing to control for significant covariates into a regression. The first effect is that found coefficients are biased and the statistical tests on these coefficients are underpowered. Thus, in order to solve the selection problem mentioned, a double-lasso regression method is explained. In that sense, the research question of the paper is the following: “Which is an optimal method of covariates selection that eludes biased coefficients and underpowered statistical tests?”

<p style='text-align: justify;'> One strength of the paper is its introduction of the double-lasso regression method in steps (three steps). Another strength is the comparison between this method of covariates selection and other methods, namely a selection of all covariates when possible, a selection via step-wise regression, and a selection via p-hacking. The comparison extends to the revision of two procedures that roughly approximate the double-lasso, which are the two-step multiple regression (including all potential covariates, and then re re-running the regression removing non-significant covariates) and the double-forward regression (using forward regression to do both steps, with modified p-value cutoffs). In short, this allows a comprehensive placement of the actual method regarding its alternatives. On the other hand, one of the weaknesses of the paper is in not including a more detailed explanation about the penalization lambda parameter, for which the reader is referred to a Stata code resource.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Additionally, one contribution, external to the answer to the research question of the paper itself, is that the paper describes the actual dangers of using a lasso regression in correlational analysis, which is a good explanation for any general-purpose a read could have. Some of the contributions related to the research question are the following. First, the paper addresses the comparison between double-lasso regression and its alternatives in terms of bias, root mean squared error (RMSE), size and power, hence characterizing the model in terms of the magnitude of coefficients in connection with their population values (accuracy of coefficients) and in terms of the accuracy of statistical tests based on these methods. Second, the paper shows the effectiveness of this method (double-lasso regression) for the selection of valid covariates by applying it in many studies previously carried out with different methods. More schematically, the variety of cases of study chosen allows to conclude that this method is useful to identify covariates in analyses of correlations, moderation, mediation and experimental interventions, as well to test the effectiveness of randomization. In summary, the two great contributions of this paper are that a) it shows how this method is superior to other methods and b) it shows the context of applicability of such method.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Finally, two issues can be continuing to be researched: adding variables with no theoretical explanation despite it contributes to the estimation process and determination of the accurate penalty term. since this determines the number of covariates.
