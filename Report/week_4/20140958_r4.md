This article aims to overcome the selection of control variables in research. Failure to control for *valid* covariates can yield biased parameter estimates in correlational analysis or randomized experiments. To do so, the authors propose *double-lasso regression* as a tool for variable selection. Considering the variable selection problem in omission bias for correlational analysis and the power of an experiment for experimental designs, *double-lasso regression* can help identify the valid regressors.   

The paper presents a theoretical approach for the *double-lasso regression*. It can even be considered an algorithmic approach since it proposes the following steps: (i) finding variables that predict the dependent variable ($X$), (ii) finding variables that predict the independent variable ($Y$). A significant strength of this paper is the comparisons made between the alternative models in simulations and replications of studies. A clear example of the *double-lasso regression* is when various studies indicate different effects of the same variables, such as the analysis of fatherhood and life satisfaction. A disadvantage of this document is that the method can only provide empirical support for the inclusion of covariates; however, it cannot determine which variables make logical sense or the theoretical justification of those. 

The main contribution of the paper is evident. It introduces a simple way to tackle down the variable selection problem. We can use many regressors without worrying about overfitting or *lasso regression* problems (underestimating non-zero covariates). Therefore, predictions could be more precise. Regarding the further research opportunities, the next step is to discuss whether adding variables without any theoretical explanation even when they contribute to the estimation.
