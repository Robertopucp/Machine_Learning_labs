# Urminsky, O., Hansen, C. and Chernozhukov, V. Using Doble-Lasso Regression for Principled Vriable Selection.

Report 4 

In this article, the authors introduce double lasso regression as the main method for the selection of variables. The lasso method is used to avoid overselecting potentially false covariates; furthermore, it reduces error and increases statistical power. To develop the subject, the authors first mention the main problems that occur when trying to control the variables; for example, the decision to control or not the variables generates problems of degrees of freedom and false positives. This leads researchers to feel that it is simpler and more conservative to report main effects without covariates. Second, they propose the lasso regression method which can help researchers to select variables for inclusion in the analyzes. However, the lasso method has a problem, estimated coefficients that are other than zero are often underestimated. Therefore, in the third part, he proposes the double lasso regression method to be able to solve all these problems. Finally, it provides some examples of how double lasso regression is used. In my opinion, the main strength of the document is how it develops the subject, it goes step by step. They present the problem; then a first solution; then the real solution and finally some practical examples.

The next step for paper would be the main problems for double-lasso method, because every methods have problem.
