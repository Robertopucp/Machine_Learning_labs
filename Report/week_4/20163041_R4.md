### Double Lasso variable paper:

The variables selection may be one of the important  factors in a empirical investigation such as in economics, sociology and other social science. Making mistakes when controling the variables can produce biased parameter estimates in correlations analysis. However, there is a solution on it, the double lasso regression which can perform an estimation better that lasso regression and it can test the effectiveness of randomization.

So, the big question on that lecture might be. which are the best covariates the researcher should select?

According the reseach, there is a problem selecting the covariates when valid covariates are excluded. For example, the experimental manipulation can resolve the problem of covariates selecting, but in the practice attempted random assignation can not yield the desired independence. In addition, not always its clear how selecting the correct covariates so the treatment of covariates is confusing in the case we are evaluating the variables as demographis. Also, some statistic methods are recognized to perform a poorly performance. One clearly example is the overfitting the data and inflatting R**2.

Thus, in this paper about the double Lasso Regresssion deployment  is very useful at the moment we want to indetify which covariates are better in analysis across a range of situation. There are some examples in the lecture where it explain the double lasso variable can be pretty useful as a method to identify some important covariates in analyses of correlation, the moderation and more. In that sense, the authors propose the double Lasso regression provide a better on covariates selecting. In this way, the objective is to find out covariates finding those that predict the dependent variable and those that predict the independent variable. The sencond step is highly important, because excluding the covariate that predict a dependent variable can do a substantial bias. 


In conclusion, the paper offers us a better understanding about that methodology called double Lasso regression. It can perform a special range on the covariates and which of them are the best in a empirical investigation. Of course the steps used are not very hard to understand and logically its an alternative in investigations where the researcher has a lot of varibles in the data.
