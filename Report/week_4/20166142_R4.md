<p style='text-align: justify;'>Analyses that do not consider adequate predictors of the dependent variable may suffer from multiple problems such as bias in the estimated coefficients. In avoiding these problems, controlling for covariates can be used. However, in psychological research, whether or not to control for covariates and especially how to select which covariates to include is still part of the discussion, and there is no clear guidance on this issue. This discussion is because not controlling for appropriate covariates can lead to biased parameter estimates and contribute to underpowered analyses. Faced with this problem, the authors present double Lasso regression to select variables in correlational studies and experimental designs. Therefore, the article's research question would be: could double-lasso regression be used as a principle method for variable selection?

<p style='text-align: justify;'>To answer the research question, the authors explain the theoretical and application part. They explain why the choice of variable selection with double-Lasso and not with a direct Lasso regression and explain clearly and briefly the steps to be used in the "double-Lasso" variable selection procedure. The demonstration of the usefulness of the double-Lasso method is performed by simulating a data set. There is a comparison of the suggested method with five other alternatives. The results of the double-Lasso procedure are very close to the results of the "true baseline", and substantial improvements in statistical power and reduces error than the others are observed. Then, using data from previous research in the literature, the authors re-analyzed using the double Lasso method and attached scripts in different programs, such as STATA, R, and SPSS. These scripts help those who would like to understand how to employ the double Lasso method in these programs. 

<p style='text-align: justify;'>The article's contribution is fundamental because it is developed in a field with little clarity on the variable selection despite its relevance in research. This is valuable since when performing the regression of a model, it is vital to choose the appropriate regressors to achieve the best and most accurate estimation and greater statistical power. The double Lasso method is useful for selecting appropriate covariates because it does not over-select potentially spurious covariates. In addition, it is also applied to analyze the effectiveness of randomization and identify which established covariates have sufficient empirical support for inclusion in correlation analyses and randomized experiments or, in any case, to identify other possible covariates that could be included. However, it should be clear that the method does not determine the logical sense or theoretical justification for including such covariates.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>An important issue is the determination of the penalty term; although the authors explain and give suggestions on how to establish it according to previous works such as that of Belloni, Chernozhukov, and Hansen, I consider it is still necessary to advance in this field to determine an adequate penalty term as it determines how many covariates will be included in the regression.
