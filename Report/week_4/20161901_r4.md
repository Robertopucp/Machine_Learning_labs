## Paper: Urminsky, O., Hansen, C., and Chernozhukov, V. (2016). *Using Double-Lasso Regression for Principled Variable Selection*
### Name: Alexander Pacheco (20161901)

Select which covariates to include in a regression is always important. Both add irrelevant covariates and omit important ones lead to biased parameter estimates. Because of that, the authors present in the paper the double lasso method to identify relevant covariates in a regression.

Some of the strengths of the paper are the way of presentation and the importance of the method proposed. First, the authors present the problems that cause variable selection. Followed by it, they present the double lasso as a solution of this problem. All this process makes the article easy to understand to the reader. Second, as mentioned earlier, double lasso method solves a problem efficiently. The authors test their method and compare the results with different ones. This proves the importance of the method in order to select and propose accurate models.

To end this review, I muts emphasize the empirical support that the article has. So, the next steps to move forward on this question should be to use and test this method to answer economic questions and propose improvements if necessary to contribute to the literature.
