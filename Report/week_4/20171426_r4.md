# Report 4: Using Doble Lasso Regression for Principled Variable Selection

Urminsky, O., Hansen, C., & Chernozhukov, V. (2019) explain what the Double Lasso Regression is and how to use it, how it can prevent the covariate selection problem in correlation analysis or in randomized experiments, and examples using real data from previous investigations. 

One of the strenghts of this paper is how the authors connect the problem established (the covariates selection problem) and the solution presented (the Double Lasso Regression). By first presenting the limitations caused by this problem (biased coefficients,statistical power of the experiment, among others) and the origins of it (limited information, no existing an especific method for the selection of covariates, etc.), they provide the reader with requirements the solution must have. With this in mind, they present the Double Lasso Regression, which complies with some of this requirements but also holds its own problems (that, however makes it a better method than available alternative options). This helps to understand the advantages and disadvantages of it, and with this decide in which ocassions (amount of data available, type of analysis, etc.) its use is recommended. 

Nevertheless, the paper has its own limitations as well.Although it's helpful the use of examples to prove the usefullness of the Double Lasso Regression, it cannot be enough evidence to generalize its usefullness for a whole discipline to use it. Also, the short or almost omitted explanation of the penalty term ($\lambda$) in the main part of the paper's body is reprehensible. Despite they mentioned it the appendix section, a more complex clarification of how the value assigned to this term is relevant to this method is needed, even if they recommend using the *theorical* estimation of it. 

This paper advanced knowledge because it presents a valid tool to prevent the omitted variable problem that can be produced due to the way we select covariates. It is a good balance of the competitive edges and downsides of the Doble Lasso Regression. Apart from that, the paper could be improved. 
 Maybe include a revision of similar papers that have proved - with different examples - that the Double Lasso Regression has helped with the covariate selection problem. In addition, it its needed to expand the explanation of $\lambda$ and make more explicit its rol in the Doble Lasso Regression, as well as other possible  ways to determine its value.
