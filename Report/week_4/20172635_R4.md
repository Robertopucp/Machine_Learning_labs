The document is developed within psychological research, where the problem of control and selection of covariates is present. The author introduces double lasso regression for the selection of variables. This method identifies which are the relevant covariates, as well as can check the effectiveness of randomization. So that he does in this document is to implement in a practical way the double lasso methodology to four data sets. In this way, the author shows the usefulness of this methodology. To do this, first talk about the covariate selection problem and double-lasso variable selection. The last explains that the difference of lasso is that its equation includes a penalty term. In addition, it mentions the biases that can occur when using it and how to overcome them through the double-lasso variable selection procedure. Then he analyzes each of the 4 selected documents with the double lasso method.

The main strength of the document's approach is that it presents the theoretical part and its application. As noted in the previous paragraph, the structure of the document first shows a theoretical part and then the application of this theory to each of the four data sets. Even at the end of the document it shows the codes used in Stata, R and SPSS. With regard to weaknesses, the methodology used yields covariates whose effects or interpretation are not defined because this depends on a theoretical basis.

The document, through the application of the double lasso methodology, shows that it has greater power in the selection of covariates to include and which ones not.

Finally, the author emphasizes that the double lasso method is useful to be able to select the variables; however, these are not explained and for this the theoretical basis is important. So the empirical results can be a guide to know which variables to focus on. This would be the next step, the explanation of the variables found.
