### Using Double-Lasso Regression for Principled Variable Selection 
### By: Elizabeth Nicole Linares Camus

The main objective of the article is to introduce the method of the doble lasso regression as a method that allows us to select which covariate include in a research. Thanks to this method, we can reduce error and increase statistical power in our estimation. First, the author mentions the problem that can happen when we omit variables that are important in our regression, if we exclude these variables, our estimate can have a bias, so the estimated coefficient can be artificially strong or artificially weak. 

To not fall in this problem, there are different methods that we can use, but, in the document, they highlight the efficiency of the Double-Lasso. Indeed, this method helps us to avoid the Type I error. Thus, to follow this method correctly there are three important steps to take account, first predict the dependent variable with a lasso regression and keep the variables with non-zero coefficient, then do the same with the independent variable and finally do a linear regression with the dependent variable, independent variable and the variables selected in the previous estimates. 

The authors not only specify this method, but they also proof the efficiency of it by doing some analysis. They study four cases and the result of them give us the conclusion that the Double Lasso method is really useful when we want to identify covariates when we do analysis of correlations, experimental interventions and even it helps us to evaluate the effectiveness of randomization.
