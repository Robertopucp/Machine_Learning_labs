## What is the research question of the article?

The article wants to show how Double Lasso approach can be applied to some cases. The article answers two questions from my POV.

* What is double Lasso and why is it useful?
* What are some examples of DOuble Lasso regression ?

## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering that question?

The papers main strenght is that it combines an theoretical introduction and complements it with empirical studies examples. It is also more readable than the previous  Chernozhukov's paper we had the opportunity to read. One slight weakness is that the paper doesn't compare the previous result of the presented studies in tables but just mentions it. I would have been helpful to include those results in a table at the document and not just in the document's appendix.

## How does this document advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution? 

The document complementsthe knowledge by analizing spceial cases such as experiemnts context.  Previous Lasso applications we've seen were not suitable to an experiemnt context at all. The present article introduces DOuble Lasso as a siutable thecnique to deal with this data. Furthermore, the document is not limited to answer a theoretical question but it also present some empirical to support it's hypothesis.

## What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to move forward on this question?

It would be valuable to apply this methods to answer economic questios.There would also be valuable to include codes of python or R  since there's only a Stata code.
