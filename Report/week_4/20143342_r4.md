The assigned article introduces us to the double Lasso regression method due to the need to control for valid covariates in psychological research. This, to avoid biased parameter estimates in correlational analyses, in samples that have not been randomly selected or to obtain unconvincing results in random samples. Thus, thanks to the double Lasso method, it will be possible to select the true covariates that are necessary for the simulations, reducing the error and increasing the statistical significance. This identification of covariates will make it possible to test the effectiveness of randomization for better predictions in the analysis of correlations, moderations, mediations and experimental interventions.

Firstly, the problem in the selection of covariates is mentioned, since, although it may be beneficial, the findings may end up being false and there are no established principles to follow, so it is preferred to estimate without covariates and obtain the main effects. Experimental independent variables could be used so that they are not correlated with any omitted variable and bias is eliminated in an estimation with a randomized sample, but in practice, tests confirming successful randomization are not performed. Moreover, in a small sample, more predictor variables cannot be increased; and, otherwise, the inclusion of more variables overloads the regression. Thus, in general, controlling for covariates affects the researcher's degrees of freedom, since manipulations can be made in favor of the perspective that one wishes to show, which may be false.

Secondly, we propose a possible solution to these problems, which is double-lasso regression. This will allow us to identify variables that predict the dependent variable at one stage and others that predict the independent variable at another stage. In contrast to a linear regression, lasso regression will find estimators that minimize the sum of squared errors with an additional penalty term. Thus, coefficients are set to zero to reduce overfitting and variable selection is performed, which reduces the number of regressors even in small samples. The problem arises because non-zero estimated coefficients are underestimated and those excluded may have moderate effects, creating a significant regularization bias effect and omitted variable bias. Therefore, double-lasso variable selection is suggested, where a lasso regression is used to predict the dependent variable, then predict the focal independent variable, always revising to variables with non-zero estimated coefficients, and ending with a linear regression of the dependent variable to the focal independent variable. In fact, the double-lasso procedure is compared with a regression without covariates, one with all possible variables, one with all covariates selected stepwise, one that maximizes the chances that the independent variable is significant and one that uses the correct variables. It is found that the double lasso presents good statistical power results and has better performances.

Finally, it explains the results of four analyses using this variable selection method. It begins with a correlational analysis of parental life satisfaction, which turns out to be explained by the characteristics of demographic differences between those who are parents and those who are not. Controlling for covariates, there turns out to be a significant relationship between parenthood and lower happiness, while a positive significance is found between parenthood and thoughts about the meaning of life. The next analysis is a mediation analysis of the happiness of conservative individuals. In it, controlling for covariates, there is a significance between political orientation and happiness, although this coefficient of orientation decreases and the mediation becomes non-significant when rationalization of social inequalities is included. Thus, it is shown that the study is sensitive to the inclusion of a complete set of covariates with the double-lasso method. For the third, we have a spurious experiment on rejuvenation, which takes into account comparisons and small sample size. It is found that there is insufficient empirical support for including covariates, moreover the univariate regression had no significant effect. In the last experiment of suggested defaults in the donation appeals, three covariates are identified with which a double-lasso regression can be shown to select valid covariates and increase the power of the experimental tests. In conclusion, the double-lasso method can control the selection of valid variables for the different studies mentioned, yet it does not allow us to substantiate the significance of this choice, but only provides an empirical basis. With this, further studies or research can be carried out to determine the role played by the selected variables or how their effects should be interpreted.
