To study people's behavior, psychological researchers've tried controling the covariates like way to isolate the effects of one construct(s) of interest. But, they could commit errors in bias on proccess of variable selection.This article explains about the usefulnees to use Double Lasso's two-step method, specially to take a decisi√≥n on which covariates are convenient to include in analyses models relative to psychological research applied in four datasets.

Problems like correlation between variables with the focal independient variable, invalid exclutions covariates, or estimation coefficients wrong predicted make to use experimental manipulations as independent variables. But, the weakness in the practice is selecting covariates and some researcher avoid to use it. Simmons, Nelson and Simonsohn contributes to show how some aplications make an error. 

The lasso regresion could be give us a solution, because it minimize the sum of squared errors same way to normal regresion, but it includes an additional penalty term that reduces the estimated coefficients towards zero and potentially setting coefficients on some variables exactly to zero, both of which help reduce over-fitting. Also Lasso regresion selects covariables, so it is important in case when the size of observations are small relative to the numbers of predictors. Althought, some observations could be underestimated and excluded some importants variables which explain the dependient variable. At the end, lasso regresion commit biases too.

The Double-Lasso variable selection strengh proposed is divide step by step the regression identifyng covariates for inclusion, finding those that predict the dependent variable and those that predict the independient variable. Last step helps to solve aleatorization and to calibrate over-fiting similarly to lasso regresion habitual. Analyses in datas demostrated that double lasso variable selection how utility is, include, would be a principle method to identify covariates in analyses of correlations, moderation, mediation and experimental interventions.

I considered that one next step is if Double-step lasso could be useful in other contexts, or ir another kind of studies. Probably, it will help to have more support author's point of view. Giving us more ways to applicate the  model.
