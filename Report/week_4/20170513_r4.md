The article by Urminsky, Hansen, and Chernozhukov mainly discusses the problem of selection of covariates in a regression. As the authors explain, the presence of covariates is important: they help control for different factors that may affect the dependent variable, aside from the main explanatory variable chosen by the researcher; otherwise, the omission would end up introducing bias in the estimated coefficients. However, they notice, the problem with covariates is selecting the appropriate ones, and that there is not really an effective methodology for selecting those covariates that actually perform appropriately. So, the authors propose the Double-Lasso as a method to efficiently select the relevant covariates through two simple lasso regressions with the independent variable and the explanatory variable of interest against the covariates, keeping track of the non-zero coefficients and finally using only the relevant covariates to estimate the model with only the relevant covariates. 

The authors present a theoretical yet simple approach to the Double-Lasso method, which makes the article understandable and the methodology easy to follow. They also contrast their method to alternative ones using simulated data, which helps to argue the advantage of using Double-Lasso. Moreover, they test the model with real empirical analyses, where thereâ€™s a dispute over the relevance of including control variables or not (highlighting the relevance of the discussion proposed in the article), and where Double-Lasso can perform in different contexts (like randomization or mediation). Overall, the article is pretty solid and accomplishes the purpose of presenting the methodology without overcomplicating the explanation. The only detractor of this approach would be that such simplification may make the article a little simple for what is trying to present when taking a more detailed approach could be more enlightening. For example, when discussing spurious variables, or mediation, the procedure seems glossed over, instead of taking its time explaining how double-lasso may or may not correct these problems.

As pointed above, the discussion of the selection of covariates is relevant, strikingly so as the authors point out mixed results have been found in empirical analyses, depending on whether or not the researcher has included the relevant control variables. An approach that helps to pick the relevant covariates is true of great importance for estimating better, more accurate models.

The apport of this method is outstanding, as the search for the appropriate covariants is sometimes exhausting for researchers. With the methodology presented, it is determining those variables is certainly easier, which ultimately helps to reduce the bias on the estimations. The next step to applying this methodology would be the discussion of actually including these covariates: is it worth adding variables one cannot theoretically explain, even when they contribute to the estimation?
