#### Article: Using Double-Lasso Regression for Principled Variable Selection
#### Autor: Oleg Urminsky, Christian Hansen and Victor Chernozhukov
<p style='text-align: justify;'>The purpose of the paper its to find a practical solution to the problem of principled variable selection for covariates, in this case specific for the study in psychologic research. In psychology the presence of covariates presents a problem, both in their selection as well in determine the importance of those variables. Researchers to avoid this problem, bias the results of their studies by not including them in their regressions.  <p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>The paper cover and answer the question in a progressive way, first run the regressions avoiding the covariates, then adding all of them (True model-baseline). Then the authors try different possible methods of solutions to the problem (Stepwise regression, Two-step multiple regression and Double-forward-regression), they conclude, after comparing the results of the regression, that the best fitted model is the double lasso. They found that the omission of the covariates significantly altered previous research results (positive to negative correlation of happiness in parents and nonparents).One critique to the paper could be the limitation that could perceive the reader to the double lasso method. This is because the papaer is focused on a specific area of study (psychology). <p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>However, the question is really well answered, and not only this, but it provides a great deal of material regarding really detailed econometric applications for people who want it, in more than one statistical program (Stata and R). <p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>The replication of the regressions with different data sets would be a valuable next step, together with the extension of the field of use of the method to other areas outside of psychology. Also something that the authors emphasize is that the theoretical intuition of covariates cannot be replaced by econometric methods, so that although it is a very useful tool, it must be taken into account that theoretical research is as important as the empirical one . <p>
