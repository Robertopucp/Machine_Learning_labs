# Using Double-Lasso Regression for Principled Variable Selection 

### 20172574


In the different studies applied in psychology there has been the problem of whether to include covariates and how to correctly select them and due to the difficulty of this problem many authors chose to omit this process which generates bias in their results. Therefore, the authors of the paper wondered if through the double-Lasso method they can solve these problems and in the cases where this problem did not exist (experimental tests) improve the estimations.

The strength of the paper is that the authors explain the problems caused by not using covariates and explain how the double-Lasso method corrects these problems. In addition, they compare the performance of the proposed method with five alternative methods in different scenarios. In this simulation they show that the double-Lasso method performed better. However, this method has limits as it empirically shows which covariates to use, however, these may not be logical or have theoretical justification.

The authors by presenting the double-Lasso method allowed to solve the problem of the correct selection of covariates that besides performing better increases the power of experimental tests.

Although double-Lasso regression allows us to improve the selection of covariates, it is important to point out that this method does not replace the theoretical explanation of the variables, but rather complements it. Therefore, a valuable step is to incorporate this method as a complement in the research and not to rely solely on this method.
