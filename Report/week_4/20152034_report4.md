USING DOUBLE-LASSO REGRESSION FOR PRINCIPLED VARIABLE SELECTION

------

 The  text introduce us to the double-loop regression method due to the need to control for valid covariates in psychological research. Thus, thanks to the double loop method, it will be possible to select the true covariates that are necessary for the simulations, reducing the error and increasing the statistical significance.


First, the problem in the selection of covariates is mentioned, since, although it may be beneficial, the findings may end up being false and there are no established principles to follow, so it is preferred to estimate without covariates and obtain the main effects. Experimental independent variables could be used so that they are not correlated with any missing variable and bias is removed in an estimate with a randomized sample, but in practice no tests are performed to confirm successful randomization.Also, in a small sample, no more predictor variables can be increased; and, if not, the inclusion of more variables overloads the regression. Thus, in general, the control for covariates affects the degrees of freedom of the researcher, since manipulations can be made in favor of the perspective to be shown, which may be false.

Second, we propose a possible solution to these problems, which is double-loop regression. This will allow us to identify variables that predict the dependent variable in one stage and others that predict the independent variable in another stage. Unlike linear regression, loop regression will find estimators that minimize the sum of squared errors with an additional penalty term.

Therefore, the coefficients are set to zero to reduce overfitting and variable selection is performed, reducing the number of regressors even in small samples.

Therefore, the selection of double-loop variables is suggested, where a loop regression is used to predict the dependent variable, then predict the focal independent variable, always checking the variables with estimated coefficients other than zero and ending with a linear regression. of the dependent variable. to the focal independent variable.

In fact, the double-loop procedure is compared to a regression without covariates, one with all possible variables, one with all covariates selected step by step, one that maximizes the chances that the independent variable is significant, and one that uses the correct variables.The double loop is found to exhibit good statistical power results and have better yields.

Finally, it explains the results of four analyzes using this variable selection method.Controlling for covariates, it turns out that there is a significant relationship between parenthood and lower happiness, while a positive meaning is found between parenthood and thoughts about the meaning of life. In it, controlling for covariates, there is a significance between political orientation and happiness, although this orientation coefficient decreases and mediation becomes non-significant when the rationalization of social inequalities is included.

Thus, it is shown that the study is sensitive to the inclusion of a complete set of covariates with the double-loop method. It is found that there is not enough empirical support to include covariates, furthermore the univariate regression had no significant effect. In the latest experiment of defaults suggested in donation appeals, three covariates are identified with which a double-loop regression can be displayed to select valid covariates and increase the power of the experimental tests.

In conclusion, the double-loop method can control the selection of valid variables for the different studies mentioned, but it does not allow us to support the meaning of this choice, but only provides an empirical basis.
