Nowadays, the use of linear, logistic regressions, decision trees, neural networks and so on have become very popular and useful due to great advances in computational and statistical matters. Many of these models have made advances in medicine, statistics, economics, sociology, psychology and many other fields. Thus, it is essential to make every each model  as effective as possible in order to improve future findings in the different fields of science. One of those methods used in order to make them more effective is double lasso regression, which in the empirical field -so far- is the one that has had the best results. Next, the article “Lasso Regression for Principles Variable Selection” by Urminsky, O., Hansen, C., & Chernozhukov, V. will be described in depth below.

First of all, I will begin by stating the goal of the authors' research. The authors attempt to answer the question: Should covariates be controlled in a regression? If the answer is affirmative, under which methods do we select variables to include in regressions?

Secondly, I will highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the article's approach to answer the question.

On the one hand, one of the strengths of the article is that, in the first place, it reviews the literature to describe the problem of variable selection: omitting variables that predict the dependent variables and, at the same time, they are correlated with the independent variables can generate a bias in the estimation of parameters. In second place, it reviews the literature on how another author has proposed a solution to the problem of variable selection: the use of experimental manipulations as independent variables. This is importat because the reader -in case he is not familiar with the matter- can fully delve into the author's proposal.

In addition, another of the article's strengths is that it reviews the literature on double lasso regression and its usefulness in the field of econometrics. It describes that the double lasso regression aims to prevent researchers from exaggerating their results in type I error (rejecting the null hypothesis if this is true) and the steps -in mathematical and intuitive terms- to be followed in a lasso regression. double.

Moreover, another of the strengths of the article is the use of correlational and experimental data in statistical packages such as Stata, R and SPSS to show their findings. I consider so useful, because it makes easier for replicators to be sure and/or criticize the article. In addition, they compare the goodness of fit of the double lasso regression with other regression methods: in one where they do not include covariates, in another where they include all covariates, in another where they include covariates only from the stepwise regression and a last one where they choose the covariates that maximize the significance of the independent variable.

On the other hand, one of the weaknesses of the article is that the data approach provides social information about them, so they allow us to draw psychological conclusions. Therefore, the article bases its conclusions on purely psychological issues. In order to give greater generality and acceptance to such a regression, a focus should be given beyond the psychological, perhaps in other more economic and / or social fields.

Thirdly, the great contribution of this article is the presentation of empirical data to validate the double lasso regression method in terms of identifying which covariates can be included in an analysis of correlations, moderation, mediation, and their use for randomization.

Thus, data was taken from the World Values ​​Survey in order to provide a relationship between being a parent, life satisfaction, happiness and meaning in life. On it, some authors found that the relationship is positive. That is, those who are parents compared to those who are not show greater life satisfaction, greater happiness, and greater meaning in life. However, these values ​​may vary given the covariates included (in the case of the variable age, employment, income, etc.) and may even change sign (instead of postive could be negative). Finally, the double lasso regression presented better values in terms of goodness of fit.

Furthermore, in order to indicate the use of double lasso regression in when choosing covariates properly through mediation analysis, the authors used the National Survey of American Elections. On it, they wanted to regress happiness with the dummy variable: conservative and liberal; and the rationalization of inequality as mediators. They found that it is not necessary to include a series of covariates because it makes the rationalization of inequality non-significant. On the contrary, the double lasso regression indicates that conservatives are happier than liberals and this is explained by the rationalization of inequality; however, not directly but through covariates that relate it to happiness through variables like attending church, being married, not having a job or being disabled, and having African descent. The double lasso regression as was indicated by the author is useful in the mediation analysis.

Finally, given that one of the weaknesses of the article is that the data approach provides social information about it, then it allows us to draw psychological conclusions. Therefore, to give this regression greater generality and acceptance, they could focus in matters beyond psychological, perhaps in others like economic, social, medical and other fields of science.
