# Report 4: Using Double-Lasso Regression for Principled Variable Selection

# Diego Alonso Gómez (20171738)


To begin, it´s important to mention that the article's main objetive is to show how Double Lasso approach can be applied to some cases.Therefore, the article seeks to resolve three questions: the meaning of double Lasso and the reasons why it's useful; and show some examples about its use, and how it can prevent the covariate selection problem in correlation analysis or randomized experiments.

Also, I consider that one strenght of the article is that it engages pretty well theory with empirical studies, allowing for new readers to understand better the article´s topic. One example of this statement is when the authors connect the problem established (the covariates selection problem) and the solution presented (the Double Lasso Regression). However, two possible weaknesses I have noticed is that the paper doesn't compare the previous result of the presented studies in tables but just mentions it. I would have been helpful to include those results in a table at the document and not just in the appendix. Also, the shortening explanation that is sometimes used by the article may critically affect the ideas the article tries to present.

That being said, it is also necessary to mention thah the article complements the knowledge about the topic by setting special cases: the article introduces Double Lasso as a siutable thecnique to deal with this data. Furthermore, the document is not limited to answer a theoretical question but it also present some empirical to support it's hypothesis. Moreover, it presents a useful tool to prevent the omitted variable problem that can be produced due to the way we select control variables or covariates. 

Finally, two next steps to advance in the article's question are the next two. First, a next article can put together results of similar papers that have proved that the Double Lasso Regression has helped with the covariate selection problem. And second, to use other data types such as panel, etc.
