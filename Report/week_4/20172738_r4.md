## Name: Jesús Alejandro Soto Enriquez
## Code: 20172738


***
The article introduce the Double Lasso as method to select and know wich covariates are usefull and convenient in the goal to estimate a model. The author use this method in psicological research where there are a lot of variables and can be some correlation among them.

The main strenght of the article is that show some cases using the double Lasso method and check if the covariates are ok. This is a perfect way to aproach and show how this method can improof and correct this kind of problems. A weekness in the article is that some of the examples and their covariates are ok even if they dind't use these method, also it the author should compare his method with other in a more easiest .

This article helps in the task to select covariates and improof the power of the models in the field of psychology. Also the double lasso method can be a useful method to fight with the omitted variables problem, that in the mencioned kind of papers can be a potencial problem at the moment to estimate.

I think that the next step is to compare this method with the lateast methods in the field. Also compare if the daouble already has the same power with new models and papers of the psychological field.
