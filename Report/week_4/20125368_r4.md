In this paper, within the context of research in psychology, the author seeks to show how important it is to control for covariates and how failure to do so can lead to biased estimates. For this, he uses the Double-Loop method, which can identify which covariates can be included in the models and not select those that are not relevant. The author, through simulations, shows that this method reduces the error and increases the statistical power of the estimates.

The strength of the paper is that it provides a solution to the variable selection problem and tests said selection method on four data sets to demonstrate the usefulness of the method and improve previous results. Likewise, from the reader's perspective, the author organizes the ideas he seeks to present well. In the first place, the author explains the problem of the selection of covariates and explains why it is so relevant. Second, the author clearly explains the Double-Lazo method step by step, thus making it easier for the reader to use it. Finally, it demonstrates, through simulations, the effectiveness of the method by comparing it with the estimates without using the model (estimates without covariates, estimates with all covariates, the true-model) and also compares it with different methods that are also used to treat the same problem (stepwise regression, Two steps multiple regression and Double forward regression).

In this sense, the author contributes to the related literature by demonstrating the potential benefits of using the Double-Loop to select covariates. Likewise, the author mentions that this paper does not have the purpose of showing what the variables mean, since that must be analyzed from the economic theory, the approach that he presents can be used to provide an empirical basis to determine which variables can be taken or not into account.
