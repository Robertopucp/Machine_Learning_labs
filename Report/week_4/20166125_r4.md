#### Author: Oleg Urminsky and Christian Hansen

The questions that this article aims to answer are how do we use double lasso regression as a principle method for variable selection? And in what cases this method can be used? About the first question the author tells us that there are three step to follow to use doble lasso as a method for variable selection. The first step is to fit a lasso regression predicting the dependent variable, and keeping track of the variables with non-zero estimated coefficients. The second step is t fit a lasso regression predicting the focal independent variable, keeping track of the variables with non-zero estimated coefficients. The third and last step is to fit a linear regression of the dependent variable on the focal independent variable, including the covariates selected in either of the first two steps. Answering the second question, the author describes and show us how we can use this method (doble lasso) to identify covariates in analyses of correlation, moderation, experimental interventions and to test the effectiveness of randomization.

One of the strengths that can be highlighted in this paper is closely related to the second answer. This is basically the empirical examples that the authors have analyzed (or re analyzed) in order to show us what are advantages of using doble lasso model instead of other models as linear regression or two-step multiple regressions. Some if theses advantages are that we can use doble lasso even with small sample size and that we can also use this model to the effectiveness of randomization. Having said this is important to highlighted the weaknesses of this paper too and one that can be appreciated on the paper is that although the correlation analysis with doble lasso tells us which potential covariates have empirical support for inclusion, it cannot determine which variables make logical sense or are theoretically justified to include.

This article has really made a great contribution for answering the second questions because the authors did find many ways in which we can use the doble lasso model effectively and efficiently. Also, they were really they were really good at being able to highlight and detail the advantages of this model over another, so that they encourage us to seek more information about this model in order to apply it correctly in the cases shown.

The next step that should be done could be talk and detail how to determinate the use of lambda on the penalty term because it is really important in some programming languages where is necessary to determinate a lambda (as r).
