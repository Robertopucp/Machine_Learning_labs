This article tries to inform us how the equation established by Jacob Mincer in 1974 in his publication Schooling, Experience and Earnings has been modified under changes in data, technologies, and, above all, advances in the empirical labor economy 30 years after its publication.

To understand in greater detail, this article tries to approach the strengths and weaknesses of the Mincer equation 30 years later. According to Lemieux, one of the main strengths that persist in the equation proposed by Mincer is that the assumption of logarithmic linearity is very precise for most of the range of the wage distribution because the logarithmic linearity of income as a function of the years of schooling is, in fact, a key empirical implication of the human capital model with identical individuals proposed by Mincer.

On the other hand, Lemieux states that one of the main weaknesses is the questioning of whether the linearity of the logarithm of income is viable or not. This argument is argued by exemplifying the case of people whose years of schooling are between 15 and 16 because it gives them too much credibility. Likewise, the exaggeration of the effect of skills (either experience or schooling) on ​​earnings at the lower end of the skills distributions is considered a weakness, due, for example, to the compression effects associated with Minimum salary.


In itself, what Lemieux tries to contribute through a constructive criticism 30 years later is that, in the first place, the Mincer equation gives too much credence to certain variables such as the overestimation of the effect of experience and schooling on the income of some groups, mainly, in young workers and families with more than 3 cohorts. Above all, it is claimed that thirty years later, the Mincer equation does not fit the data as well as it used to because we are no longer in a stable environment where educational performance grows smoothly in successive cohorts of workers.

From my perspective, I think that they should make updates to the equation because times have changed and salary gaps have been changing. In addition, there are cases in which higher education is not so necessary to have a high income. Likewise, phenomena have emerged in which the labor market has been affected, such as the current COVID-19 situation that has strongly affected the economy and strong shocks have arisen in the estimates due to uncertainty.
