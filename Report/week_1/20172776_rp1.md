## **Paper Thomas Lemieux**

The paper "THE MINCER EQUATION THIRTY YEARS AFTER SCHOOL, EXPERIENCE AND EARNINGS" tries to evaluate the performance and validity of the famous Mincer equation used in fields of study of labor economics. Through several recent empirical studies and cases, Lemieux wants to observe the performance of the mincer equation. Five fundamental points are evaluated from the original Mincer equation: earnigns in log, linear education, quadratic experience, additive separability in education and experience, and cohort effects. Lemieux notes that some aspects of the original Mincer equation still adequately represent the earnings-schooling relationship and other exogenous variables, but he also proposes some improvements that could be implemented to refine the estimates. 

                                log⁡ y= log ⁡y_0 + r*S + β_1*X + β_2*X^2

**Y**: Earnigs

**Y_0**: Level of earnings of an individual with no education and no experience

**S**: Years of schooling X 

**X**: Years of potential labor market experience

- **Earnings in logs**

The paper mentions that there is a theoretical basis that justifies the use of logarithms in earnings. As mentioned by Mincer, "education should have a *multiplicative* effect on earnings in a simple model where identical individuals maximize the present value of future income which is equalized for all education levels in equilibrium" (1958, as cited in Lemieux, 2006). The paper supports this point through the evidence shown by James Heckman and Polanchek (1974) and also regressions carried out by Nicole Fortin and Thomas Lemieux (1998). Both studies validate the logarithmic linearization of income, as it fits well with most of the data.

- **Linear Education**

The linear form of education in the original Mincer equation can cause inaccuracies in the estimates. In the first place, the logarithms of the income will present a concave function of the years of schooling; second, a linear specification of years of schooling would not capture the credential effect, which occurs at the end of high school or college. Studies such as Carl and Krueger (1992) conclude that the linearity of the years of education fits the data well, except for the lowest years of schooling and between 15 and 16 years, due to the credential effect. However, studies such as Heckman et al. (1996) conclude that the linearity of schooling does not correctly represent the data due to the increase between years 15 and 16. On the other hand, Mincer (1997) and Deschenes (2001) show that since 1980 the logarithm of income has become more convex in relation to years of schooling. It is mentioned that this convexity can occur due to the differences between the demand and supply of labor. The paper mentions that the linearity of the years of education within the Mincer equation is still under debate.

- **Quadratic Experience**

The quadratic function of the experience in the Mincer equation is explained mainly by practicality effects. It is easier to regress experience and experience squared than to estimate nonlinear experience, which implies the assumption of a constant rate of decline in investments. However, the study by Murphy and Welch (1990) concludes that a quadratic function does not capture the main characteristics of the experience-earnings relationship. The quadratic form of experience underestimates earnings for the first 10-15 years and also the last 25 years of experience. However, a quartic function of the experience fits the data better and does not go outside the confidence bands. Therefore, Lemieux recommends an adjustment in the degree of experience.

- **Additive Separability in Education and Experience**

The paper shows that the additive separability between education and experience of the Mincer equation was a better fit for the 1960 data; however, for more recent data, the additive separability is not adjusted correctly. It is observed that the salary gap between college and high school graduates narrows with increasing experience. Card and Lemieux (2001) and Heckman et al. (2003) conclude that the data from the experience gaining profiles are no longer parallel. For this reason, Lemieux recommends adjusting this point of the Mincer equation.

- **Cohort Effects**

Recent studies show that the age-income relationship has varied for different age groups. Given this variation, the Mincer equation does not fit well to data from the 1980s and 1990s without adding cohort effects. Card and Lemieux (2001) show that the Mincer equation explains well the data from the 1980s and 1990s by including fictitious cohort effects. The lack of adjustment to the data is also explained given that the labor supply could not compensate for the labor demand in the 1980s.


In conclusion, the Mincer equation continues to be a useful tool for analyzing the evolution of income with respect to the level of education and experience as long as adjustments are made in the degree of experience and group effects are added to better explain some contemporary effects.
