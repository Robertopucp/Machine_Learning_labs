This paper evaluates the empirical performance of the standard Mincer earnings equation thirty years after the publication of Schooling, Experience and Earnings. During this period, there has been a dramatic expansion in the microdata and estimation techniques available to labor economists. What is the status of the Mincer equation in light of these advances in empirical labor economics? Is it time to revisit our benchmark model? Based on the existing literature and some new empirical estimates, I conclude that the Mincer equation remains an accurate benchmark for estimating wage determination equations as long as it is adjusted by (1) including a quadratic function in potential experience rather than just a quadratic, (2) allowing for a quadratic term in years of schooling to capture the increasing convexity in the relationship between schooling and wages, and (3) allowing for cohort effects to capture the dramatic growth in returns to schooling among cohorts born after 1950.

Thirty years ago Mincer published his book Schooling, exerience and earnings (1974), which was highly influential in the empirical field of labor economics. This is because of his famous Mincer equation, which has become the "workhorse" of empirical research on earnings determination. This income equation will be empirically evaluated in the present text, which was written by THOMAS LEMIEUX, since during this period of time there is greater access to microdata and new empirical estimation techniques. 
Now, what is the Mincer equation? Mincer modeled the natural logarithm of earnings as a function of years of education and years of potential labor market experience (age minus year of schooling minus six). In the most widely used version of Mincer's ''human capital earnings function,'' log earnings are modeled as the sum of a linear function of years of education and a quadratic function of years of potential experience, and why is it so popular? For one thing, it is because it is based on a formal model of human capital investment. For another, it is that the Mincer equation provides a parsimonious specification that fits the data remarkably well in most contexts.

So, among the questions the author wishes to answer are the following: What is the status of the Mincer equation in the face of current developments in empirical labor economics? Does the benchmark model need to be re-evaluated? The author mentions that the Minver equation should remain an accurate benchmark for estimating wage determination equations as long as it is adjusted by (1) including a quadratic function in potential experience rather than just a quadratic, (2) allowing for a quadratic term in years of schooling to capture the increasing convexity in the relationship between schooling and wages, and (3) allowing for cohort effects. 

First, he begins by evaluating the equation by questioning why log is used in earnings. We do not use log on education. Education has a multiplicative effect on earnings. Log is used in earnings because investments in human capital, like other investments, have a return ratio and a discount rate. If the return exceeds the discount then it is positive. Next, it is questioned why education is linear. There is the possibility of "credentials". These specifications divide education in weights by the number of years of schooling. from 11 to 12 years of schooling there is a high school credential effect, college credential from 15-16 years.  To test this, it suffices to estimate an unrestricted function of years. In one paper this function is tested and the result is that education appears to have a linear function of years of schooling, except with 15-16 years of schooling. It can be seen that in parts linear education overestimates and underestimates earnings. After that, it is questioned whether the experience is quadratic, The papers say that the specific standard quadratic is not flexible enough to capture important features of the data. It underestimates and overestimates wage growth.

To conclude, the separability between experience and education is questioned. In the past there was a separable interaction between education and experience that in recent empirical work is not being proven. You could study, but if you didn't have much experience you didn't earn less than those with experience. Now if you study but do not have experience, you earn between 15% or 12% less for inexperienced workers. In other words, we can no longer speak of the separability of these two variables. Now there is an interaction between the two. And finally, he mentions cohort effects. Before there did not seem to be effects between years of data and age groups. Now the paper separates data from different censuses and age groups 5 by 5. It is seen that for each census there are different slopes in the income gap and each age group. This is related to the fact that they were more educated before or that they are less educated until now. It may also be due to a change in the demand and supply of employment.
