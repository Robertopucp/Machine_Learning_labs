Reading Summary 1
In this article we will review the validity of the Mincer equation, since this equation has had a very deep and lasting influence on the determination of wages.
In the introduction it is mentioned that the Mincer equation continues to be used in academic research and that it is the most parsimonious way to obtain the salary estimate. 
In the same way, mention that if the Mincer equation is not a good approximation it is because we are using inaccurate information.
Then we move on to a delimitation of the content of the article and how the Mincer equation can change with technological advance and its validity in research in labor economics. 
First, it is questioned whether the natural logarithm is the appropriate transformation for income. About this, it is mentioned 
that there is a strong justification for using logarithms of earnings in a human capital regression and that the existing evidence supports the logarithmic specification of earnings. 
For this he mentions that the reason is that investment in human capital is only carried out while the rate of return on the investment exceeds the discount index. 
On the other hand, using large samples, they find that the logarithm of the wage is close to a linear logarithmic function of the human capital index for wage values above the minimum wage. 
However, this assumption of logarithmic linearity requires most of the wage distribution.

Second, it is analyzed whether education should enter the equation in a linear way and if the potential experience should enter as a quadratic function. 
In the case of schooling, he mentions that mean logarithmic earnings can be a convex or concave function of years of schooling. He also adds that schooling can have a direct impact on earnings. 
To test such linearity, he mentions that logarithmic earnings can be estimated as a non-parametric function of years of schooling and see if this function is approximately linear. 
In the same way, he mentions that not all returns to education are normal, there are few abnormal relationships. Finally, they mention that according to Card and Krueger, that the logarithms 
of income are an approximately linear function of the years of schooling, except for the two lowest percentiles of the distribution of schooling. In the case of potential experience, 
it happens that investments in on-the-job training decrease over time in a human capital model with a standard life cycle. Furthermore, this measure is adopted because it is much 
easier to estimate a regression model with experience and experience squared included as regressors than to estimate the more complex non-linear experience profile that implies the assumption
 of a constant rate of decrease of investments that is more consistent with economic theory.

Third, the separability of schooling and experience, and whether the effects of the cohort should be included in the income equation. Regarding separability, 
it is mentioned that if said empirical relationship for data from more than forty years ago, it is maintained for more recent data. Thus, logarithms of earnings are
 additively separable functions of schooling and potential experience, even though they do not fit well with current data. In the case of the cohort, although important
  changes in the relative supply of different age groups and education can induce important changes in the structure of wages that must be taken into account when estimating
   a standard Mincer equation, recent evidence suggests that Mincer's Basic Human Capital Income Model remains a parsimonious and accurate model in a stable environment where 
   educational attainment grows smoothly across all cohorts.
