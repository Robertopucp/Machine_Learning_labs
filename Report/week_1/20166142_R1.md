<p style='text-align: justify;'> Since the publication of Mincer's book "Schooling, Experience, and Earnings", there has been an impressive advance in the handling of databases and the techniques available to carry out economic research estimates on wage determination. Therefore, the author wonders how the Mincer equation stands in the light of these advances in the empirical estimates of labor, whether it is time for the model to be revised or not, i.e., whether it is still valid for wage determination. For the analysis of Mincer's equation, the author focused on the most widely used model in the empirical literature, the logarithm of the wage is modeled as the sum of a linear function of the years of education and a quadratic function of the years of work experience.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> To answer the research question, the author bases on previous research in the literature such as Card and Krueger (1992) when analyzing whether or not the logarithm of salary is a linear function of years of education or Murphy and Finis Welch (1990), who conclude that quartic function of years of experience would fit the data better than quadratic function. On the other hand, the author not only summarizes the main results of the research but also makes his empirical estimations using updated databases to complement the authors' findings with solid empirical results. Moreover, empirical results show a retrospective look at the evolution of the Mincer equation's performance with an updated database, which allows us to see how the relationship between the variables has been changing over time. However, the estimates are based on data considering only men. At present, one of the most discussed topics in labor economics is the wage gap between women and men, so it should be taken into account when seeking to answer this question. In addition, some factors could change the interaction between labor demand and supply, like occupational mobility due to migration and changes in the labor market structure, among others. This changes the environment in which we can use the standard Mincer equation because, as we have seen, in an unstable environment, it does not fit the data accurately.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Although the author does not contribute new ideas, I consider the article concisely synthesizes the results of the different research that have implications in determining the Mincer equation as an accurate "benchmark". In addition, it keeps in mind the debate on whether the Mincer equation is adequate or not to estimate wages and, based on the discussion generated, to understand better the precise relationship between the logarithm of the wage, the years of education, the years of work experience. In addition, the article acts as a photo of everything advanced in a comprehensible way. It contributes to our view of the standard Mincer equation, i.e., not to see it as an equation that estimates accurately at all times, but that we should be aware that it has limitations that we should consider when making our interpretations of the estimates. For example, when the author mentions that the Mincer equation is accurate in a stable environment, but when the period is unstable, it is not accurate because the relative supply did increase enough as the growth in relative demand. On the other hand, in econometric terms, the article highlights the importance of verifying the robustness of the standard Mincer equation when a quadratic term in  years of schooling and cohort effects are taken into account.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Finally, an important point to advance in this question is to analyze whether the variables taken into account to estimate are enough to determine the wage. While it is true that in labor economics research today, the standard Mincer equation is commonly used, I think we should also ask ourselves if it is enough that the person's education is reflected only in the years of education or we should take into account the quality of the education received. This question is essential since educational quality is a questionable topic in developing countries such as Peru. Therefore, it would be interesting to analyze if and how much the quality of the education received influences salary determination.
