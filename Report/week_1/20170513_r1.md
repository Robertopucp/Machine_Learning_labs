# Report  1: The Mincer equation

This reports goes over the main points of the paper "The 'Mincer Equation' thirty years after _Schooling, Experience and Earnings_" written by Thomas Lemieux in 2006.

<br />

## 1. Research question

---
The main purpose of the paper is to revise the standard Mincer equation. As the author states, given the current data and technological tools available, it is worth questioning whether or not the model proposed by Mincer should still be considered the benchmark in empirical labor economics. Specifically, the author questions whether the equation “is truly the most parsimonious model of earnings determination that would be obtained through careful econometric specification testing.”

## 2. Methodology

---
In order to reappraise Mincer’s equation, the author revises the different variables present in the original equation –the dependent variable, earnings, and the exogenous variables, years of schooling and potential labor market experience— through an empirical approach. To do so, he presents recent findings corresponding manipulations of each variable, as well as his own estimations. For example, when questioning if the years of potential experience should be included via a quadratic or a quartic function, the author presents previous findings on the topic: other authors had already recommended that a quartic function was a better fit for years of experience. Then, Lemieux proceeds to supplement these findings with results of his own, using the Current Population Survey (CPS).
 
The empirical approach is useful because it directly demonstrates how certain adjustments to the standard Mincer equation yield more fitting estimations. This is evident from the statistical results included in the paper. However, this empirical approach also presents certain issues. First, the adjustments are not studied jointly. It is never explicitly stated how a completely adjusted Mincer equation (one that includes all the changes suggested by the author) would perform with current data. Second, the empirical approach lacks the generality that a more mathematical approach would offer. The model has to be tested in order to see how it fits the data, but there is no general rule behind it.

## 3. Contributions

---

The most important contribution of the paper is collecting and testing recent findings regarding the standard Mincer equation. In doing so, the author presents, in a very concise manner, which adjustments should be made to the Mincer equation in order to better fit current data, using the most recent, powerful, statistical tools. The author states explicitly which corrections should be used and in which cases, and suggests a verification of the robustness of the standard Mincer equation through empirical testing.

## 4. Following steps

---

One of the main reasons for reappraising Mincer’s equation is the fact that the data is changing. As the author explains, new effects and interactions are taking place, resulting in the need for more sophisticated models. This statement brings attention to the source. It is important to know how and why the data is changing: is it a general phenomenon? How much exactly is the wage structure changing? What is causing it to do so? From answering these questions, one will be able to decide whether the standard Mincer equation will require further adjustments in the near future.
