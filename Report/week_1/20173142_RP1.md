# Report 1 - The ‘‘Mincer Equation’’ thirty years after schooling, experience, and earnings

The paper written by Thomas Lenieux has as main goal answer the question of how useful and precise is the the standard Mincer earnings equation in the face of new advances in the labor economy during the last 30 years. To do this, the author asks different questions and analyzes how efficient this equation is when introducing different variables that have begun to be taken into account recently in the labor economy. As result of this questions, in a lot of section of the paper, the author propose some changes to the equation which will reduce the possibility to overestimate or underestimate some variables.

One of the strengths of this paper is the ease of identifying variables that do not adequately fit Mincer's simple human capital function, some of these variables such as experience or schooling can be overestimated and move away from what really happens in reality.

The biggest contribution of this paper is the fact that, even though the Mincer equation was proposed many years ago, Mincer's human capital income function remains a parsimonious and relatively accurate way of modeling the relationship between income, schooling and experience.

Finally, one of the most valuable steps that can contribute to the main objective of the paper is to evaluate many more variables that can affect the Mincer equation, and to be able to test whether this equation can continue to be used in a couple of years.
