## Mincer equation(1954)
$$  log y = log y_0+rS+\beta_1X+\beta_2X^2                                $$

## __Questions__

- ¿Cuál es la pregunta de investigación del artículo?
Since the first time that the Mincer equation appers in the academic field pass more than 50 years. The autors want to know how does the Mincer equation stand througth the time and advances in empirical economics? Is it time to revise our benchmark model? The main objective is to know if the mincer equation is still vigent in the academic field like an accurate instrument and know how the time change the effectines of these tool.
-  ¿Cuáles son las fortalezas y debilidades del enfoque del documento para responder a esa pregunta?
Strengths: the structure of the paper is based on the changes in each variable related to the mincer equation. These can help to touch each topic from a meticulous way. Also the arguments of the author is based on a variety of papers with  solid empirical evidence.
Weaknesses: I think that the authors could contrast their ideas with more papers from another countries, not only with papers related with United States. Also, there aren't a contrast of papers related to the posture of he author. these means that the authors only mencioned papers that agree with their ideas and take that like a suficent argument to question the Mincer equation and don't mention if there is a paper that contradict their posture.
-  ¿Cómo avanza este documento el conocimiento sobre la pregunta, es decir, cuál es la contribución? (Si
no puede encontrar alguna contribución, pregúntese por qué el editor y los árbitros decidieron publicar
el artículo).
The authors analize the validity of the Mincer equations in the academic field as an accurate tool. They compile some and point out some papers where the Mincer equation present problems to estimate earnings. Also dive into the possible reasons of these problems and the posibles changes in the base form of the equation to mitigate the errors.
-  ¿Cuáles serían uno o dos próximos pasos valiosos y específicos para avanzar en esta pregunta?
The next step could be use data sets from another countries to understand the validity of the Mincer equation in other countries more than US. Also get into more changes like the laboral structure or now in the pandemic. Its important to show after the mincer equation, which is other good and accurate tool in the field of labor economics and what are the main differences.
