# THE ‘‘MINCER EQUATION’’ THIRTY YEARS AFTER SCHOOLING,EXPERIENCE, AND EARNINGS BY THOMAS LEMIEUX

##### 20172574 - Daniel Carrillo


The literature in the field of labor economics has been deeply influenced by Mincer, who in the publication of his book Schooling, Experiences and Earnings in 1974 modeled the logarithm of earnings as a linear function of years of education and quadratic of years of experience in the labor market, unlike previous studies that took age as the main regressor. The novelty of incorporating potential experiences as a standard regressor was made because there is no single rate of return, but it differs for each group (high school or college) and allows incorporating the effect of age on earnings.

1.
Due to the simplicity of the Mincer equation, it has been used for a long time and in different countries for research on wages and education. Therefore, the paper seeks to determine whether the approach made by Mincer is empirically fulfilled or whether the equation should be reformulated to obtain true results on the determination of wages.

Unlike Mincer, Lemieux has a larger database, from 1979 to 2001, which allows him to perform analyses between different time slices such as 1979-1981, 1989-1991 and 1999-2001. In addition, technological advances allow him to incorporate higher degree polynomial functions into the equation. However, this is also a problem because since 1992 the data suffered a change because the structure of the survey does not allow identifying workers with 15 or 17 years of schooling.

First the paper analyzes academically and empirically each variable and whether its formulation is correct. Thus, it is found that the log earnings formulation is the correct one because it fits the data. For the case of education, it concludes that it should not always be formulated linearly because it can be formulated as a convex or concave function over log earning, since there are certain years of education that have a greater effect on income. Likewise, this also depends on the years of the study since for the years 1979-81, the linear function is correct, but for 1989-91, log earnings are a convex function of the years of schooling. In the same line, for 1999-2001, Lemieux proposes that the most appropriate function would be a quadratic function. On the other hand, the quadratic function of expertise over log earning is not appropriate because it underestimates the growth of wages between 10 and 15 years of schooling, so a quadratic function is the best.  Finally, Lemieux finds that for the years after 1960, the specification of log earnings as a separable function of schooling and potential experience is inadequate.

The next step would be to incorporate new variables or effects in the Mincer equation since the economic and social scenarios are changing over time, for example and as pointed out in the paper, for certain periods there are lags between demand and supply of skilled workers, which generates cohorts’ effects that prevent a correct analysis of the relationship between income and education and consequently, the Mincer equation loses validity in these scenarios. In addition, a separate analysis can be performed for each group of workers.
