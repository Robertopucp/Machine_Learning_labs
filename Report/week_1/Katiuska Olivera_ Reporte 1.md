#### Article: The Mincer Equation 30 years after "Schooling, experience and earnings.
#### Autor: Thomas Lemieux
<p style='text-align: justify;'>ItÂ´s been more than 30 years since Jacob Mincer published "Schooling, Experience, and Earnings" (1974), book in which has been presented the well known Mincer equation. This equation had a deep and long lasting influence on labor economics. However, since then there has been produced some important changes: the advance of tecnology has allowed to gather a larger number of micro data that sets available for empirical investigation, as well the development in the computer power. Due to change in the context of the tools for the empirical investigation and the larger number of data available the question that motivate this article is: How does the Mincer equation stand in light of all these advances in empirical labor economics? </p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>The research in this article is based on a wide variety of authors, who present solid empirical evidence. Each of the variables involved in Mincer's equation is analyzed separately (log of the earnings, linearization of education and increase of coefficients in experience) and jointly(cohort effects), this leads to when it comes to readjusting the equation, much more precise results are found (changes in certain periods, better fit of the data with respect to each modification and the original equation). Despite this, the article has some weaknesses. The data used for the empirical investigation are almost in his totality american males, this lead to two problems:Bias in the results to other countries with more labor heterogeneity (third world), as well as the integration of the female labor force is not taken into account, which has increased exponentially since the 60's (sample taken for the Mincer equation).</p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'> The article seeks to critically analyze the Mincer equation, evaluate its performance and accuracy over time. This work has been done before by many other authors (Krueger 1992, Heckman 1996, etc), so the article acts as a short and accessible compendium for the reader about the evolution of the equation over time. Although it does not provide new information, it exposes the ideas proposed above with clarity and order, leading the conclusion of the article to a new question: Is it time to revise our benchmark model?</p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'> In a recent New York Times article, the earnings of adults (18-34 years old), for the first time in history, are lower than their counterparts in previous generations, however, it has been established that this is the generations most educated than their predecessors (27% have a Bachelor's or higher). Undoubtedly this unstable enviroment phenomenon can respond to a change in the offer and demand of the skilled and educated workers (in which the Mincer equation would be unfailingly less effective).  
Another important point to consider within the labor economy is related to the enormous technological advance and the creative destruction that this entails with respect to work (machines replace labor and human capital).
This is why a benchmark model review is more than necessary, where the fit of the current data is reviewed (difference of almost 14 years from the last sample) and the model is adjusted to the much more unstable context that is presented to us today. </p>
