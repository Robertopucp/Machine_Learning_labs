- The author, in this article, tries to evaluate the standard Mincer earnings equation after thirty years of its publication in Schooling, Experience and Earnings. To do that, he starts evaluating if the natural logarithm is the most appropriate when it comes to transform the earnings for the equation. Then, he discusses the idea of putting the education linearly in the equation, also the idea of using a quadratic function for the potential experience and the additive separability of education and experience. 

- A strength we can find in this document is that the author uses bibliography from other authors that had studied the topic. For example, he quotes the article of Heckman and Polachek (1974) when he referres to the log-earnings specification and he also quote Card and Alan Krueger (1992) when he talks about how log earnings arenâ€™t a linear function of schooling. On the other hand, a weakness from the paper could be the fact that he uses data from United States of America, that could be a problem because maybe the results are different in another country, especially the ones in Latin America where the context is totally different. 

- The contribution of this document are the results that the author was able to find. Therefore, we know now that the classical earnings equation may not fit completely with the currently data, because the result he had when he compared the data of 1960 and 1970 with the one in 1980 and 1990 was different. Also, he concludes that sometimes using this equation we can overstate or understate the impact of experience or schooling depending on the age of the groups. 

- As I said before, the author only uses data from United States of America. In my opinion, it would be interesting to use data from developing countries and try to evaluate with them the Mincer earnings equation.
