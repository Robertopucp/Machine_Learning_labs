In 1974, Jacob Mincer published his landmark book Schooling, Experience, and Earnings, in which he modeled the natural logarithm of income (wage) based on years of education and years of potential experience in the labor market.

$$  log y = y_0+ rS+\beta_1X+\beta_2X^2   $$

In this paper, author Lemieux search for to evaluate the empirical performance of Mincer's standard earnings (wages) equation thirty years after the publication of his book. Lemieux argues that during this period, there has been a great expansion in data sets and estimation techniques. So, the research question is: How does the Mincer equation stand in light of all these advances in empirical labor economics?


<p style='text-align: justify;'>
One of the main strengths of the paper is that it tests Mincer's equation with data up to three decades ahead. In addition, in each case that Mincer's regression has not complied with accurately modeling the relationship between wages, education and experience, the author justifies it with some temporary change, since the new data are also affected by the new conjuncture.

A weakness of the paper to answer the research question is that it doesn’t address the different extensions of Mincer's wage function (it only uses the basic equation). In addition, it’s only based on empirical studies with CPS data exclusively for American households.

On the other hand, this paper analyzes separately each fragment of the Mincer equation and tests them with data from later decades through empirical works carried out by other authors. 

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
First, given these advances in empirical labor economics, the logarithm used by Mincer in the dependent variable for the equation is still well-founded. Using samples from the ORG (1979-1991) it is found that the wage logarithm is close to a linear logarithmic function of the human capital index for wage values above the minimum wage, in other words, it’s very accurate for most of the range of the wage distribution.

Second, on the part of the linearity of the education variable, this is still an open discussion. Mincer (1997) and Olivier Deschenes (2001) show that since 1980, wage logarithms have become an increasingly convex function of school years. This is shown in Figures 11.3 to 11.5 in the text, which show data for decades beginning in 1979. It can be seen that the education-wage relationship suffers from an increasing convexity as time progresses.  Mincer (1997) argues that this growing convexity is easily explained by an increase in the relative demand for skilled labor in a model of human capital investment with heterogeneous workers. So, the linear approximation can only be accurate in a stable environment where the growth of relative demand is matched by the growth of relative supply.

Third, the Mincer equation includes a quadratic function in years of potential experience capturing the fact that investments decrease linearly over time. Using data from the CPS (1964-1987) it is concluded that a  quadratic function is not flexible enough to capture the experience-salary relationship, since the quadratic function underestimates the growth of earnings during the first 10 to 15 years of career. On the contrary, they find that a quartic function in years of experience captures very well the main characteristics of empirical experience-salary profiles.

Finally, Mincer's standard equation in which logarithmic wage is an additively separable function of schooling and potential experience don’t fit as well with recent data as it used to in the 1960 census. This is because the data that came after the 60's census didn’t have a stable environment where educational achievements grow without problems in all groups (cohort). In such an environment, major changes in the relative supply of different age and education groups can induce major changes in the structure of wages that must be considered when estimating a standard Mincer equation.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
A valuable next step would be to see if the adjustment of the Mincer equation has improved in these 2 new decades by enthusiastically assuming that we are no longer in an unstable environment, but in an environment where educational performance grows without problems in successive groups (cohorts) of workers.
