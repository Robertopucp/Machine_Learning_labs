## What is the research question of the article?
This article attempts to answer how Mincer's earnings equation is performing following advances in technology and the increase in data available for empirical research on labor economics that allows estimation of wage determination equations.

## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering that question?
A strength of the article is the presentation and description of several empirical studies on the Mincer model, which allows us to know the results of these studies and compare them to highlight the deficiencies shown by the standard equation. Additionally, it is remarkable how it shows possible suggestions according to the evidence shown for possible studies that could make future modifications or estimations. On the other hand, the test of fit of the estimated schooling-wage relationship rejects a linear or quadratic specification given the significant deviations on years of schooling which is described by the author, however, despite suggesting the need to add higher order polynomials, he does not specify or estimate it accurately, it is only a matter of waiting for future empirical studies to correct the robustness of the equation. 

## How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution?
Among the main contributions of this paper is that, given the uneven changes in relative labor supply and demand, as well as the slowdown in the rate of growth of the educational attainment of workers born after 1950, the claim about the use of a linear approximation in the simplest version of the Mincer equation cannot be fulfilled, since this can only occur with data from a stable period, where the growth of relative demand corresponds to a growth of relative supply. Furthermore, the importance of adjusting the Mincer equation by adding higher order polynomials in the potential experience is presented, since even the quadratic specification also predicts a spurious decline in wages among older workers. In turn, it is found that, within the equation, not forming an interaction between log earnings with schooling and potential experience gives rise to a mismatch with the most current data. Finally, according to the evidence reviewed, it is possible to continue using Mincer's basic human capital earnings model only if educational attainment grows moderately in a stable environment; on the contrary, relative supply gaps of different ages and education should be taken into account in the estimations because they may change the wage structure.

## What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to advance this question?
The suggested approach to problems of mismatches due to age and education mismatches is to add cohort effects to the standard version of the Mincer equation or to model relative supply and demand for different groups of workers. This is because people with less experience have a higher educational level than those with more experience, so the increase in the supply of educated labor is not proportional to the growth in demand. Also, it would be convenient to add higher order polynomials of potential experience in the model, since the main equation overestimates or underestimates the effect of experience and schooling on the earnings of some groups, specifically, on the earnings of young workers.
