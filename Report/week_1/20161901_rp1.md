## Paper: Lemiux (2006). The "Mincer Equation" thirty years after *Schooling, Experience, and Earnings*
### Name: Alexander Pacheco (20161901)

Mincer earnings equation has been analized and used by different researches around the world since its publication in 1974. This report describes the main ideas and conclusions of the paper by Lemiux (2006).

The purpose of this paper is to analyze  the Mincer equation and its components to see if other specifications should be consider. This analysis was done many years after its publication, during this time a lot of work has been done on labor economic research and technological evolution allowed new methods of study with more powerful computers.

The author follows a structure in which he analyzes the components of the Mincer equation and, in some cases, proposes alternatives in order to have an accurate model that fits with the new data.

With an empirical approach, the author makes differents conclusions. First, he supports the log-earnings specification as the dependent variable. Second, he points out that education should be included in the equation with a quadratic specification. Third, he proposes a quartic specification instead of a quadratic for the potential experience variable. Fourth, the Mincer standard equation does not fit the recent data when there is no interaction term between log-earnings, education and potential experience. Finally, the author also concludes that cohort effects should be consider in the equation because of the different returns of schooling for people who born in the different years, which grew dramatically over the years.
