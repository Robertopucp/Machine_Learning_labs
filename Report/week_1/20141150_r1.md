# Report 1: The Mincer equation thirty yeras after schooling, experience and earnings -  Thomas Lemieux
Claudia Mirela Vivas Alejandro - 20141150

## What’s the research question of the paper?
The research answers the following question: “How does the Mincer equation stand in light of all these advances in empirical labor economics?”

## Which are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper’s approach to answer such question?
The research tries to answer the question mencionated above, in this context the author intends to critically reevaluate the standard Mincer equation after thirty years of the publication of Schooling, Experience and Earnings, most outstanding work of Mincer. The author also states that he will address the robustness of the Mincer equation as a complement to previous research such as Chiswisk and Polanchek. In this sense, the author adopts the literature review and empirical results based on the Current Population Survey (CPS) for the years 1979 to 2001 developed by himself as his research approach.

Regarding strengths, the research reassesses and makes adjustments for each component of the Mincer equation and its relationship between them, asking whether the natural logarithm is the appropriate transformation for earnings, whether education should enter linearly and potential experience should enter as a quadratic function in a separable earnings. equation. Finally, whether cohort effects should be included in the earnings equation. On the other hand, his approach is innovative, since he reviews the literature and complements it with empirical results with more current data and incorporates changes to the Mincer equation that he develops throughout the research.

Regarding the disadvantages, the research question ends up being very ambitious, because although the components of the Mincer equation are reassessed, it doesn't validate the validity of the Mincer equation as benchmark in comparison with other empirical advances. Likewise, the research approach takes away the scientific rigor that we see in scientific papers, where the mathematical and econometric development of the model is one of the main points. In this sense, the adjustments made to the Mincer equation lack of rigor, as well as robustness of the model where there isn't any econometric test. However, the author is aware of the limitations of his research and mentions it at the beginning.
## What’s the contribution of this paper towards the construction of a proper answer to the question? 
The most important contribution is the review of previous work and adjustments to the Mincer equation. As the author concludes, the standard Mincer equation works in a stable environment, but 30 years later it needs adjustments as there is no longer a stable environment. Three adjustments are proposed:
1. Include a functional quartic form in the potential experience
2. Include a quadratic form in years of schooling
3. Allow cohort effects to capture growth in returns to schooling among cohorts born after 1950.

## Which would be one or two following significant step(s) in order to keep developing an answer to the research question?
This research could continue by including data until recent years, including women in the analysis of the labor market, since the research data were only for men, and making a compared study with some other country.
