1.  What is the research paper question?

    There has been a profound and lasting influence on empirical work in the field of labor economics of the Jacob Mincer's landmark book *Schooling, Experience and Earnings (1974)*. 

    For the sake of critically reappraise the standard Mincer earnings equations thirty years after Mincer (1974), the guiding question that Thomas Lemieux stands for in this paper is **how does the Mincer equation stand in light of the advances in empirical labor economics?**

2. *Having that question on mind...*  
 Which are the strength and weakness of this paper approach?


    On the one hand, as this paper holds to answer to empirical questions, it is constructed by a thread of issues related to the robustness of Mincer's original specifications. In each of them, it considers a brief literature review that re-thinks what Mincer (1974) stated and then generates a small debate about what was taken for granted before and what, with the secular development of empirical labor economics, it can be observed thirty years later. I'd add that as the author is looking for analyse the Mincer equation, I find it important to try to understand each component of this equation and to re-evaluate how it can be either taken or read thirty years later.  

    Nevertheless, on the other hand, this brief review considers recent studies that only used CPS data from American households. That may be understandable as far as Lemieux addresses his paper to reappraise the standard Mincer earnings equations, but wouldn't it be worth it also to consider data from other countries or to create any kind of arrange between developed and undeveloped countries? This could confirm or even propose a new revision of Mincer equation.

3. How does this paper contributes to the research question?

    It is notable that thirty years after *Schooling, Experience and Earnings* is not only observed in the empirical labor economics advance, but also in the new literature review that proposes to re-think Mincer's human capital earnings function. Being that said, Lemieux's paper not only accepts that Mincer equation is a relatively accurate way of modelling the relationship between earnings, schooling and experience - even though he also suggest that it is important to verify the robustness of the standard Mincer equation to the inclusion of a quadratic term in years of schooling and cohort effects -, but thirty years later it still works among the empirical labor economic research on earnings determination.

4. What would be any specific next step to advance on this research question?

    As the Mincer earnings function is the cornerstone of a large literature in empirical economics, next steps related to Lemieux's research question would be the discussion of the theoretical foundations of the Mincer model and to examine its empirical support first using more data sources. This because while data from the 1940 and 1950 Censuses provide some support for Mincer’s model, data from later decades are inconsistent with it. Important differences arise thirty years later, and so does fifty year later. Due to the recent period of rapid technological change, this may also change the analysis of schooling decisions. In the presence of sequential uncertainty and option values, this cornerstone of classical human capital theory may not be a useful guide to policy analysis.
