# **Report 1: The ‘‘Mincer equation’’ thirty years after schooling, experience, and earnings**

## In this research article, the author's main objective is to evaluate the validity of the Mincer equation after the advances in the literature on labor economics issues (new estimation methods) and the presence of a greater amount of microdata. Therefore, focusing on the form of the Mincer equation, he evaluates the logarithmic presentation of earnings, linear relationship of education, quadratic experience, education-experience relationship, and cohort effects. On the first evolution, he points out that there is a solid theoretical justification, and the evidence that exists generally supports this specification.
## In the second evaluation, he points out that it is still an open debate with mixed evidence. Card and Krueger (1992) favor the linear relationship between education and the logarithm of earnings but warn of lower levels. On the other hand, Heckman et al. (1996) are against this linear relationship. Furthermore, Mincer (1997) and Olivier Descheˆnes (2001) warn that since the 1980s this relationship has been taking a more convex form. For these reasons, the author makes new estimates to shed more light on the existing debate. He assesses the effect of schooling on male wages for 1979–81, 1989–91, and 1999–2001. He obtains results similar to those of Card and Krueger (1992) only in the first period of evolution. For the other evaluation periods, he finds results that support Mincer (1997) and Olivier Descheˆnes (2001) (increase in convexity). Therefore, the author is against the linear relationship.
## Third evaluation, he makes estimates for the periods 1979-1981, 1989-1991, and 1999-2001, using CPS data on wage rates per for men. He obtains similar results to Murphy and Welch (1990). Therefore, he concludes that it is necessary to refine the Mincer equation by adding higher-order polynomials in the experiment (possibly of the fourth degree).
## The fourth assessment determines, for data after the 1960 census, the logarithm of income is no longer an additively separable function (without interaction terms) of schooling and potential experience.
## Fifth evaluation, using cohort effects on education and age in the Mincer equation, better results can be obtained. This is because the Mincer equation is a model that provides good results in a stable environment where educational attainment grows smoothly in all cohorts. In more recent times, the environment is quite unstable so it is important to introduce cohort effects to obtain better approximations.
## Based on the various results, the author concludes that the Mincer equation is a useful reference point in a stable environment and allows it to serve as a starting point for research topics in labor economics related to the determination of income. The four evaluations the author performs are important, but he highlights the results of his latest evolution. Likewise, the conclusions about the Mincer equation are important because it offers insights on a subject that had not been so explored and opens a new path or approach for future research. These facts are the main contribution and strengths of this article. However, with the constant changes at the world level (product of globalization) and the breadth of the economic and social gap between countries, the inferences and results of the article may be out of date. This fact would be the main weakness of the article. However, it also shows the path of the question addressed. With the various changes the world has undergone in the last decade and the historic milestone of the pandemic, it would be important to evaluate the situation of the Mincer equation in this new scenario and to build a new theoretical framework for future research. On the other hand, it would be important (due to the expansion of the data presented) to explore this approach for various countries (mainly developing) and not just for different years. This would have broader comparability and possibly very diverse results.
