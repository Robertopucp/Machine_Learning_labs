According to Lemieux (2016), Mincer equation "provides a parsimonious specification that fits the data remarkably well in most contexts." (p. 128) However, after 30 years since its publication, it might be difficult to conclude that Mincer equation “is truly the most parsimonious model of earnings determination that would be obtained through careful econometric specification testing.” (p. 129) Considering the new estimation techniques, the availability of microdata and the changes in the labor market, Lemieux (2016) revises this *benchmark* model to answer whether the Mincer equation remains in force after 30 years. The following report states the main ideas found in this paper.

## 1. Research question
---
The main objective of Lemieux (2016) is to critically reappraise the standard Mincer equation and evaluate its empirical performance. It is worth questioning whether the model proposed by Mincer (1974) should continue to be considered the benchmark in empirical labor economics considering the current data and econometric techniques available.

## 2. Methodology: strengths and weaknesses to answer the research question

---
To reappraise Mincer’s equation, Lemieux (2016) reviews the functional form of the Mincer equation and each of the variables (dependent and independent), questioning the econometric specification. That is, it analyzes (i) the validity of the logarithm of earnings ($log(\gamma)$), (ii) the linearity of the years of education ($S$), (iii) the quadratic form of the years of experience (actually, years of potential experience as $X^2$), (iv) its separability, and (v) the validity of the cohort effects.

To do so, Lemieux (2016) reviews recent findings on the validity of  Mincer's original specifications, as well as his own calculations. By doing this exercise, he focuses on the robustness of the Mincer model for predicting earnings.
However, as he properly states, his main limitation is that he "only focus[es] on the issue of the robustness of Mincer's original specification." (p. 129) It means he leaves behind a review of literature for earnings determination. Additionally, he just uses information from the United States (Current Population Survey - CPS) for the period 1979-2002.

The empirical approach is helpful to question the Mincer's  specification since it graphically demonstrates an alternative form to fit estimates. However, Lemieux (2016) explores these functional forms separately instead of a joint approach of every recommendation. He does not perform any regression or estimation with its proposal for the Mincer equation.

## 3. Principal contributions

---

The main contribution of Lemieux (2016) is reviewing and testing recent findings of Mincer's specifications. The author concludes that it is necessary to "fine-tune" the Mincer equation, including higher-order polynomials (up to a quadratic) of potential experience to the basic model. It also reviews and proves recent studies that question Mincer equation. Thirdly, the author remarks that the Mincer equation "does not fit the data quite as well as it used to because we are no longer in a stable environment where educational achievement grows smoothly over successive cohorts of workers." (p. 143). Despite these limitations of the Mincer equation, this model "remains parsimonious and relatively accurate way of modeling the relationship between earnings, schooling and experience." (p. 143). Moreover, an important contribution to our knowledge is to think out on the importance of verifying the robustness of the econometric models to be used.

## 4. Further research opportunities

---

As the author proposed, the next step in research might be the fit of the Mincer equation in the next decade as the wage structure appears to be stabilizing again. Secondly, further analysis can consider a joint estimation of the specifications and recommendations remarked in this document, that is, estimating a "fine-tune" Mincer equation with current data. Finally, it would be interesting to understand the current dynamics behind the labor market to determine if it is still a "stable environment" as the author mentioned.
