## Report 1: The "Mincer Equation" thirty years after schooling, experience and earnings.
#### Autor: Thomas Lemieux

The paper evaluated for this report is all about the more traditional “Mincer Equation” that is as follow.
 
 $$log(y) = log y_0 + rS + B_1*X +B_2*(X^2)$$

Where Y is earnings (y_0 is the level of earnings with no education and no experienced), S is years of schooling and X is the years of potential labor market experience.
Knowing this Mincer equation, it will be easier to develop the question that this report attempts to answer, which will be answered in the following lines.

##### 1. What is the research question of the article?

The author of this paper tries to evaluate whether it is accurate keep using the traditional Mincer equation as a benchmark to calculate the earnings using years of schooling and years of potential labor market experience as showed in the equation at the beginning, despite the different kinds of advances that have been made in empirical labor economics, or whether it is necessary to change or stop using this equation.

##### 2. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to answering that question?

This paper has some strengths than can be highlighted. One of them is that the author carried out wide research of different authors who have done some empirical works using the Mincer equation to calculate the earnings for periods of time that differ with the periods studied by Mincer (periods of time between seventies and 2001), which made him realize that there are some problems with the equation that can be improved or solved (as the cohort effect). Another one is that the author carried out his own empirical work, for the same periods of time as the authors he studied, using the Mincer equation but with some differences from the original that made a better approximation of the earnings (these modifications would be mentioned in the next question). However, there is also a serious weakness on this research and it is that this article is only focus on determining earning to white and nonfarm men but they don’t take into account women, which is a terrible mistake because while the number of women in the labor sector back then was not as large as it is now, it was still a big number. This mistake could bias the result of this paper so it has to be solved.

##### 3. How does this document advance knowledge about the research question?

The contribution of this paper is closely linked to the strengths mentioned before because thanks to that widely research of different authors and his own empirical work he could give some advices how modify the Mincer equation on a way that the earnings calculation would be better. The first advise is to add higher order polynomials (up to a quartic) of potential experience to the basic model because the basic model understate wage growth for younger workers. The second recommendation is to control the cohort effect by separating by birth groups because the log earnings may either be a convex or a concave function of years of schooling depending of the birth’s group (usually more convex after 1970’s).

##### 4. What would be the next steps to move forward on the research question?

The next obvious step to move forward, as it was mentioned, would be take into account woman at the moment of use a sample because of this way we can avoid bias at the moment of doing the regression. In addition, it would be good to do a clear delimitation to what sector this equation could be used because according to some authors that are mentioned in this paper the Mincer equation does not do a good calculation of earning to people with low years of schooling and this could represent a big problem calculate earing in poor countries where most of people have a low level of schooling. Take this into account would help to modify the basic equation of a way that could be used in different kind of countries.
