The research question of the paper is whether the Mincer earnings equation is still adequate to explain the relationship between earnings, years of schooling and years of experience. In order to do this, it questions whether education has a multiplicative effect in earnings (and thus the log especifications of this is adequate); whether a quadratic equation of experience is useful to explain the earnings or if it needs a higher-degree equation; whether this last term should be an additively separable function of schooling and potential experience, and whether the adittion of cohorts effects could help fit the model better.   

The overall strenghts of of this paper, and that the autors take advantage of, is that it uses new data sets and computational power that wasnâ€™t available before in the mid-1960s. Graphs of quartic equations, plots of the coefficient estimations and confidence intervals of various regressions, detailed and recent data sets of massive surveys are evidence only possible to the pass of time and development of technology.  In that way, it holds strong evidence to reffuse or approve their claims. As a matter of fact, the hypotheses they hold are well aligned with the purpose of the paper by questioning if the parts of the Mincer equation are  still relevant. This presents another advantage since it allows the reader to understand what exactly are the said problems with the Mincer equations and how they can be proved to be significant. 

However, this paper only uses data sets from USA to challenge the evolution of the Mincer equation and it seems a little naive since one can believed that labor markets in other countries with high levels of informality and labor missallocation will present a different kind of relationship of the earnings with education, experience and age. Also, it leaves some decisions to possible changes/solutions in the Mincer equation to question. For example, Was a quartic equation for experience the best fit? Why not try to fit a higher-degree equation?, or Do they inquiry about the quality of the data set used by the other investigator whose paper they used as evidence to prove their ideas? 

This paper advance knowledge about the research question since it not only rassembled and reproduced the results from other papers, but also presented new estimations that complemented theirs. Throught the years, a series of inquiries for different parts of the Mincer equations were made, and since that, evidence to prove whether they were legitimate or not was produced. By compelling this information in a paper, it allows to find trends in investigation, as well as to find questions that have not been made yet and, therefore, possible flaws the equation could have develop since 1960. They obviously did this to test, for example, the quartic equation for years of experience. 

Besides that, the autors could do some adjustments. If they are trying to critically reappraise the Mincer equation (and not the results the paper it was presented), its credibility should be tested with data from countries with different labor markets, or at least from more than one country. Also, it is important to remember that the quality of the data sets used to challenge a theorical equation such as the Mincer is key. In that way, the assumptions taken about it should be carefully examinated and made more explicit.
