### Questions about the research of Mincer equation:

1. What is the research question of the article?

- According to the research, the main question is to check out the standard Mincer earnings after trirthy years. In other words, How does Mincer equation stand in advances in imperical labor economics. 

2.  What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to answering that question?

- One of the weaknesses is if log earnings is a linear funtion or not, because others researchers hold that log earnings are a non-linear function of schooling and there is a increase in earningis bettween 15 and 16 years of schooling. Therefore,  The log earnings have already become a convex function on years of schooling. Also, the approximation linear based on Mencir explanation can be stable where the demand correspond to the relative supply. In years post 1980, they have been unstable, because the supply didnt increase enough to balance the growth of relative demand. However, one of the  strengths of this paper is the model proposed by Mincer continues to be useful in the stable environment where there is an increase in academic performance successively in time as well as in the time that Mincer's form was proposed. But that is no longer possible because we are not in a good environment like in the Mincer years.


3. How does this document advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution?

- In summary, there are two types of conclusion from this paper. Firstly, the Mincer equation can overstate the effect of experiences on the earnings of some groups of young. In particular, this problem can be fixed adding higher order polynomials of potential experience to the Mincer basic model. Also, this model make a mistake on the effect of skills on earnings in the skill distribution. Secondly, the experience-salary are no longer different education groups. The college-high of school salary is much larger for less experienced than more experienced workers. These departures from the  Mincer model are consequence of the fact that recent increases.

4. What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to advance this question?

- In my point of view, I would say the Mincer equation must be adjusted to the new changes in economics topis.  Also with regard to the issues of education and salary that is observed throughout the reading, it can be concluded that times have changed and not only the same ones in which Mincer was and his equation. Therefore, I argue that the Mincer equation should be adapted to recent years and, therefore, improved. In general, not only the Mincer equation must be improve, every  economic equation need to be fixed in order to project what happens in the labor market and in the economy.
