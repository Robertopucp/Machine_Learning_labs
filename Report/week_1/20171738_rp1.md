# Report  1  --> The Mincer Equation: Thirty Years After Schooling Experience, and Earnings

### Diego Alonso Gómez (20171738)


## 1. Research question

---

In my opinion, the article research question is to determine how good is the “Standard Mincer Equation” relative to the advances in empirical labor economics that were developed  until the date of the article publication. All of these is emobied in the next question that the author establish: How does the Mincer equation stand in light of all these advances in empirical labor economics?.


## 2. Strengths and Weaknesses

---
I consider that the most important strength of the article approach is that it incorpores and systematize the contributions of a large list of empirical authors to the development and improvement of the estándar Mincer equation. However, one important weakness of the paper is that some of its suggestions may be not correct in other contexts than american society.

## 3. Contributions

---
I consider that the contribution of this papers to the knowledge about the question is the identification of some problems that can arise with the use of the Standar Mincer Equation. I would also say that other contribution from the article is that each of the variables involved in Mincer's equation is analyzed separately in this text, which allows the Mincer Equation being understood in depth.


## 4. Following steps

---

In my opinion, the next step that future investigations can follow is to try to estimate the equation with in multiple contexts and scenarios, that because the data related to income and education is constantly changing around the world, which implies more need to apply the most recent estimation techniques to be able to test the econometric equation proposed by Mincer.
