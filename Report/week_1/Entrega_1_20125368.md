1.The research question in the article is, given the advances in computational methods and the number of microdata available for economic research, how does the Mincer equation proposed in the article Schooling, Experience and Earnings stand after 30 years of having suggested the model?

2.The strength of this approach to the article is that the author by conducting an extensive post-publication review of the empirical literature of the article Schooling, Experience and Earnings, as well as by making his empirical estimates, can refute or confirm the results of the literature and efficiently answer the research question.

3.This article demonstrates possible problems concerning the basic Mincer equation, which are: (1) exaggerating or underestimating the effect of experience and schooling on the income of some groups; (2) exaggerate the effect of skills on income at the lower end of skill distributions; and (3) Mincer's basic human capital income function does not appear to fit the data correctly in the 80s and 90s, as it did for the 60s and 70s.
In this sense, the author concludes that, although the Mincer equation is still useful as a reference point, 30 years later it no longer fits in the same way because the context in which educational performance grows is no longer stable for the different cuts of workers,  as it was in the period in which the study was carried out. 

4.The next step concerning this research is to verify the soundness of this equation by including a quadratic term in the years of schooling and cohort effects. 
Likewise, already in the long term, for the following decades, it would be ideal to carry out this study again and analyze if the adjustment of the Mincer equation is improved with these new data.
