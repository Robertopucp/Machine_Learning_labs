In this chapter, causal relationships are addressed from raw data using a combination of data and qualitative causal assumptions that are considered plausible in a given domain. So the main objective of this chapter is to help researchers communicate qualitative assumptions about cause-effect relationships, also elucidate the ramifications of those assumptions, and also derive causal inferences. In this sense, the main task of the author is related to the choice of assumptions and whether these are sufficient to evaluate the strength of the causal effects through non-experimental data. To accomplish the aforementioned, a causal diagram is constructed, which has similar characteristics to Wright's trajectory diagrams.

With respect to the Intervention section in Markovian models, from a causal diagram it is finally possible to estimate the impact of the interventions from non-experimental observations. In relation to the calculation of the intervention, obtained from the causal diagram, it provides a synthetic method to verify the assumptions of the intervention and its relationship with the observation; all this can be done because the method uses inference rules that involve intervention and observation. The problem arises when you want to derive causal effects when some data is unobservable.

Regarding the resolution of the problem that is generated when non-experimental data are used in the intervention, the author points out that if this policy evaluation problem does not have a graphic identifier or something equivalent related to a support of causal assumptions then it becomes impossible. solve the problem.

In general, it is necessary to highlight that the author addresses the problems mentioned at the beginning and is carried out by applying the practical tools that he proposes without diminishing the importance of the theoretical component involved in the model.
