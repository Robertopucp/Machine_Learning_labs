# Title: Causal diagrams and the identification of causal effects

## Names: Morales Lopez Erik Brandon

. This in chapter written by Pearl. J in 2009, is used to explore the ways of inferring the causal relationships from a combinations of data and the qualitative causal assumption that are considered in a domain. So the purpose of the chapter 3 can help the researchers to communicate qualitative assumptions about the cause effect relationship and derive causal inference from a combination of assumptions. 

I think the causal effect allow us to predict how the systems would respond to hypothetical interactions. for example, policy decisions. One way to explain it is drawing a causal driagrams to give a formal sequence and provides explicit formulas in terms of probabilities. The implications is that the effects of each intervention can estimate from no-experimental data. 

The causal diagrams can provide a powerfull tool in maths oriented on data, for example, simple tests in order to determinate if the assumptions  available are sufficient for identifying  causal effects. 

Another important tool is the graphical analysis from the casual effect which is a calculus of interventions a set of inference. It can help to determinate if a set of covariates is decent for the control and fix the measures in causal paths.
