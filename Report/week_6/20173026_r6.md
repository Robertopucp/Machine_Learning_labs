The aim of this chapter is to explore the ways of inferring relationships from a combination of data and qualitative causal assumptions that are deemed plausible in a given domain. Causal diagrams and causal graphical models have been introduced as a powerful tool for causal inference, especially in observational studies. Perhaps one of the most important and useful features of causal graphs when dealing with causal inference problems is the clear illustration of the causal relationships between the variables. As causal effects allow us to predict how systems would respond to hypothetical interventions, they rely on causal relationships. In this chapter, causal diagrams are used to provide formal semantics to the notion of intervention. The implication of this latter is that the effects of every intervention can be estimated from nonexperimental data, provided the data is supplemented with a causal diagram that is both acyclic and contains no latent variables.   

Causal effect is described as follows: 

*Given two disjoint sets of variables, $X$ and $Y$, the causal effect of $X$ on $Y$, denoted either as $P( y | \hat{x} )$ or as $P( y | do(x))$, is a function from $X$ to the space of probability distributions on $Y$. For each realization $x$ of $X$, $P( y | \hat{x} )$ gives the probability of $Y = y$ induced by deleting from the model:*

$
x_i = f_i(pa_i, u_i), i = 1,...,n $

*all equations corresponding to variables in $X$ and substituting $X=x$ in the remaining equations.*



* Controlling confounding bias 

In statistics, a confounding variable is an extraneous variable in a statistical model that correlates (directly or inversely) with both the dependent variable and the independent variable. A spurious relationship is a perceived relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable that has been estimated incorrectly because the estimate fails to account for a confounding factor. The incorrect estimation suffers from omitted-variable bias.

While specific definitions may vary, in essence a confounding variable fits the following four criteria, here given in a hypothetical situation with variable of interest "$Y$", confounding variable "$X$" and outcome of interest "$Z$":

* $X$ is associated (inversely or directly) with $Z$
* $X$ is associated with $Z$, independent of $Y$
* $X$ is associated (inversely or directly) with $Y$
* $X$ is not in the causal pathway of $Y$ to $Z$ ($X$ is not a direct consequence of $Y$, not a way by which $Y$ produces $Z$)

The concept of confounding must be defined, and managed, in terms of the data generating model. Specifically, let $X$ be some independent variable, $Y$ some dependent variable. To estimate the effect of $X$ on $Y$, the statistician must suppress the effects of extraneous variables that influence both $X$ and $Y$. We say that, $X$ and $Y$ are confounded by some other variable $Z$ whenever $Z$ is a cause of both $X$ and $$.

In the causal framework, denote as the probability of event $Y = y$ under the hypothetical intervention $X = x$. $X$ and $Y$ are not confounded if and only if the following holds: *for all values $X = x$ and $Y = y$*, where is the conditional probability upon seeing $X = x$. Intuitively, this equality states that $X$ and $Y$ are not confounded whenever the observationally witnessed association between them is the same as the association that would be measured in a controlled experiment, with $x$ randomized.
