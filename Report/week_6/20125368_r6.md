Causal Diagrams and the Identification of Causal Effects
Rodrigo Silupú Peñaranda

This chapter aims to help researchers communicate qualitative assumptions about cause-effect relationships, elucidate the ramifications of such assumptions, and derive causal inferences from a combination of assumptions, experiments, and data. The main task will be to decide whether the given assumptions are sufficient to assess the strength of causal effects from non-experimental data. In the presence of distortion in the estimation effects, causal diagrams are used to give formal semantics to the notion of intervention and to provide explicit formulas for post-intervention probabilities in terms of pre-intervention probabilities. Likewise, if some variables are not measured, the question of identifiability arises, and this chapter develops a nonparametric framework to analyze the identification of causal relationships in general and causal effects in particular. This chapter helps you to control the following problems: 
(i) The control of confounding: it is solved by “the back-door condition”, which is a criterion for selecting a set of covariates that, if adjusted, would produce an unbiased estimate of the causal effects. 
(ii) Evaluation of policies: To solve the problem of evaluating policies to predict the effect of interventions from non-experimental data. This is solved using the “do-calculus” and its graphic criteria. The completeness of the “do-calculus” implies that any (non-parametric) policy evaluation problem that is not supported by an identification graph, or an equivalent set of causal assumptions, can be shown to be “unsolvable”.
(iii) The evaluation of counterfactuals: provides formal semantics for counterfactuals. Among the techniques used to measure counterfactuals is the mediation formula, which is a key tool to assess assessing causal pathways in nonlinear models.
