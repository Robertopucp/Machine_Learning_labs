#### Article: Causal Diagrams and the Identification of Causal Effects
#### Author: Judea Pearl
<p style='text-align: justify;'>The main feature of this chapter is that cause-effect relationships are discussed extensively from a combination of assumptions, treatment experiments, and data. The author uses causal diagrams to provide plausible probabilities after treatment (the author calls these interventions), even if you are in a pre-treatment state. The use of causal diagrams is recommended in the case of confounding bias, that is, when the estimated effect may be affected by the context.<p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>One tool that emerges from using causal diagrams is calculus intervention, this leads us to be able, as a reader, to determine mathematically whether a given set of covariates is appropriate for control of confounding, deal with fails in the pathways and trate measurments with another. The calculus intervention resolves the cofounding bias effect as well (back door condition).<p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>To summarize, this chapter has three important points: The control of cofounding, as we already meantion; the policy evaluation problem, which entailed the effects of intervention in non experimental data, it resolves trough do-calculus, if the policy evaluation problem is not supported by an identifying graph, or an equivalent set of causal assumptions, is proven unsavable; and finally the evaluation of counterfactuals or potencial (alternatives) outcomes.<p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>This chapter is interesting because it not only raises practical tools to face the mathematical problem, but also does not leave aside the theory and clearly differentiates between structural and regression equations, direct and indirect effects in Neyman's model.<p>
