> **Chapter 3 of the book**: Causal Diagrams and the Identification of Causal Effects

Nowadays, Statistics has become an important tool in the research processes, since it allows planning the research, collecting, organizing, representing, interpreting and analyzing the information regarding individuals or observations of a phenomenon being studied: common characteristic, in a population or in a sample. The analysis allows describing information behaviors, drawing conclusions and giving recommendations for decision-making. For this, the so-called causal inference has been used for quite a few decades. It has already had interference in many areas of the medical, social, psychological, economic sciences, etc. In that sense, it is well considered to indentify -in a very efficient way- causal effects in Inference. That is why, Judea Pearl in his book “Causality” provide us a a tool to understand causal diagrams and the Identification of Causal Effects.

First of all, the problem that this chapter wants to study is about the total effect of an independent variable on another dependent one. However, since there are several difficulties that limit this total effect. Pearl mentioned, for example, the example -that ilustrates very well the idea- in Wainer's book:
He Considered an experiment in which soil fumigants (X variable) are used to increase oat crop yields (Y variable) by controlling the eelworm population (Z); the fumigants may also have direct effects (both beneficial and adverse) on yields besides the control of eelworms. He wished to assess the total effect of the fumigants on yields when this typical study is complicated by several factors. First, controlled randomized experiments are unfeasible – farmers insist on deciding for themselves which plots are to be fumigated. Second, farmers’ choice of treatment depends on last year’s eelworm population (Z0), an unknown quantity that is strongly correlated with this year’s population. That is how he found a case of confounding bias that interferes with the assessment of treatment effects regardless of sample size.

Secondly, an approach to a solution provided by Pearl is the use of causal diagrams: identify the variables that influence the causality of a situation and that it is possible to measure it. This could be seen as those represented by other authors such as Wright; however, there are differences between these proposals.
The major differences lie in the method of analysis. First, whereas path diagrams have been analyzed mostly in the context of linear models with Gaussian noise, causal diagrams permit arbitrary nonlinear interactions. In fact, our analysis of causal effects will be entirely nonparametric, entailing no commitment to a particular functional form for equations and distributions. Second, causal diagrams will be used not only as a passive language to communicate assumptions but also as an active computational device through which the desired quantities are derived.

In summary, the problem that this chapter wants to study is about the total effect of an independent variable on another dependent one. An approach to a solution provided by Pearl is the use of causal diagrams: identify the variables that influence the causality of a situation and that it is possible to measure it. The idea behind the author's postulate is about the study of Bayesian networks. That is, the use of deterministic equations.
