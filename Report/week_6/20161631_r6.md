# Chapter 3: Causal Diagrams and the Identification of Causal Effects

Report 6

The chapter basically explores ways of inferring relationships from a combination of data and causal assumptions. In this way, it helps researchers on cause-effect relationships, find ramifications, and derive causal inferences from the combination of assumptions, experiments, and data. This is similar to those discussed last week with the forests. Causal diagrams are used to develop the topic. Causal diagrams provide a powerful mathematical tool for analysis. Furthermore, in some cases, using simple tests it can be determined whether the available assumptions are sufficient to determine causal effects.

One of the parts that most caught my attention is the coding on "the state of the universe just before", in which the whole past is advocated, that is, that everything will influence the result. Another point is that in a causal diagram in which all direct causes are observable, the effects can be found quickly. However, when the direct causes are not observable, the process is complicated. This is explained in the example of fumigation. Another important part is the example of the relationship between smoking and lung cancer. From this example, what struck me is the conclusion, in which reasonable qualitative assumptions about the functioning of the mechanisms, coupled with nonexperimental data, can produce accurate quantitative evaluations of causal effects.
