<p style='text-align: justify;'>The third chapter deals with causal diagrams and identifying causal effects that aim to derive causal inferences from a combination of assumptions, experiments, and data. Causal diagrams reflect the researcher's understanding of the main causal influences between measurable quantities in the domain, which allows visualizing two types of links: those from non-measurable quantities and those from measurable quantities. These substantive assumptions are incorporated in the causal diagram. Likewise, causal diagrams are used to give formal semantics to the notion of intervention. When all direct causes of the intervening variables are observable in a causal diagram, we can infer post-intervention distributions from pre-intervention distributions; thus, under these assumptions, one can estimate the effects of interventions from non-experimental observations. However, the problem arises when we wish to derive post-intervention distributions from pre-intervention distributions. The problem arises when we want to derive causal effects when some direct causes of the intervening variables are unobservable. The question then arises: are the assumptions given in a causal diagram sufficient to quantify causal effects from non-experimental data?

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Another critical issue that is developed is the control of confounding biases because when evaluating the causal effect of one variable on another, the question arises whether to standardize the measurements for possible variations in other Z variables; and furthermore what criteria should be used to decide which variables are appropriate for adjustment. The problem of controlling for confounding bias is solved by the graphical test "back door criterion" and the front door criterion. The back-door criterion is applied directly to the causal diagram to analyze whether a set of Z variables is sufficient to identify the causal effect and thus select a set of covariates that, if adjusted, will produce an unbiased estimate of the causal effect. The "front-door criterion demonstrates how treatment-affected variables can be used to facilitate causal inference.  That is, a consistent estimate of the causal effect can be achieved even though the set of variables Z does not meet the back-door criterion.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Another tool that emerges from the graphical analysis of causal effects is the calculus of interventions, which consists of a set of inference rules (do calculus) that transform probabilistic statements involving interventions and observations into other similar sentences. By using this tool, a syntactic method for verifying statements about interventions is obtained. The set of "do calculus" rules has three basic inference rules of the proposed calculus: add or delete observations, Action or observation Exchange, add or delete actions. These rules are sufficient to derive all identifiable causal effects.  However, suppose the causal effect of X on Y is not identifiable and randomized experiments cannot control X. In order to solve this, the causal effect may be identifiable by randomizing a surrogate variable Z which is easier to control than X.
