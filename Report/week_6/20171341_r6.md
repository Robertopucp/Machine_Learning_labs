* Author: Pearl
* Title:  Causal Diagrams and the Identification of Causal Effects
* Year: w/d

Pearl  aims to help researchers communicate qualitative assumptions about causality. The chapter proposes two methods to achieve this. The document provides diagrams that help to understand causal relations and the underlying assumptions to estimate them. Through graphic analysis the author whether is possible to identify causal relationships.

The chapter has three main results. First it solves the cofounding problem through conditions such as the backdoor. Then it solves the olicy evaluation problem, for this purpose the chapter introduces the concept and use of the _do_ operator. Finally, it provides a formal counterfactual  semantics which is crucial to asess causal pathways in non-linear models.
