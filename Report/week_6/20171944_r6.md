###  Casual Diagrams and the Identification of Casual Effects

In this chapter, the author presents a method to inferring casual effects. The chapter starts with an example of oat crop yields ($Y$) and soil fumigants ($X$). The ideal would be to estimate the total effects of the fugimants on yields, but this estimation is complicated to realize by several reasons, for example, it is not possible to have randomized experiments, there's a case of confouding bias and a problem of correlation between variables from the past and the present. 

In general, with the method that the author explains in this document, we can avoid to fall in this type of problems. According on what he says on the chapter, this method would allow us to explicate the assumptions that underlie the model, know if these assumptions are enough to obtain consistent estimators, providing a closed-form expression for the target quantity and propose a set of experiments and observations that would allow us to obtain consistent estimates. At the end, with the method would be possible to identify if the assumptions are sufficient to estimate casual effects.

To follow this method we need to construct a casual diagram, a powerful mathematical tool. This would show us the major casual influences and would help us to understand better all the relationships between the different variables. 

The author at testing this method obtain three important results. First, it is solved the problem of controlling confounding bias. Then, the policy evaluation problem is solved too by the *do-calculus*. And, finally, it give us more tools for the evaluation of counterfactuals.
