# Causal Diagrams and the Identification of Causal Effects

Personally I found the subject new and interesting, because at least I think it has given me a new perspective and a new tool when proposing impact models (my main interest) or in general when I want to study the effect of one variable on another. I am referring to the use of causal diagrams. For this, the author starts with a brief and quite interactive example on the use of soil fumigants (variable X) to increase oat crop yield (variable Y) by controlling the eelworm population (Z), and then explains its dynamics in a causal diagram.

Speaking in a nonparametric framework of causal inference principles, causal diagrams can be consulted to determine whether the available assumptions are sufficient to identify causal effects from nonexperimental data. If so, the diagrams can be consulted to produce mathematical expressions for causal effects in terms of observed distributions; otherwise, the diagrams can be consulted to suggest additional observations or auxiliary experiments from which the desired inferences can be drawn.

Perhaps a limitation of the proposed method is that the results must rest on the causal assumptions shown in the plot, and that these cannot normally be tested in observational studies.
