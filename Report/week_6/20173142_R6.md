## Report 6: Causal Diagrams and the Identification of Causal Effects

In this chapter , Pearls try to help  researchers communicate qualitative assumptions about cause–effect relationships. For that, he proposed  simple tools that assume fewer restrictions. 

The first tool is the causal diagrams, this tool give formal semantics to the notion of intervention, and it provides explicit formulas for postintervention probabilities in terms of preintervention probabilitie.

Another tool that emerges from the graphical analysis of causal effects is a calculus of interventions, this tool derivaded from causal diagrams. Basically, this tool consists in a set of inference rules by which sentences involving interventions and observations can be transformed into other such sentences, thus providing a syntactic method of deriving claims about interventions and the way they interact with observations.That tool try to help the investigator in three ways.
First, try to determine mathematically whether a given set of covariates is appropriate for control of confounding. Second,  deal with measurements that lie on the causal pathways. Finally, trade one set of measurements for another.

In the final section, the author show us the keys results. First,  the problem of controlling confounding bias is resolved through the back-door condition  a criterion for selecting a set of covariates that, if adjusted for, would yield an unbiased estimate of causal effects. Second, the policy evaluation problem is resolved through the do-calculu and the graphical criteria that it entails.Finally, an explicit translation of interventions to “wiping out” equations, proposed by Balke and Pearl, provides a formal semantics for counterfactuals, through which joint probabilities of counterfactuals can be defined and evaluated in the framework of scientific theorie.
