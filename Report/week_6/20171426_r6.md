# Report 6: Causal Diagrams and the Identification of Causal Effects

Pearl(w/d) explores how causal assumptions and the data can help us to the learn about causal relationships. To me, this is a fresh view of how can be represent and understand causal inference problems, as well as how can solve them using non-conventional tools in Economics, such a causal diagrams.

 When in presence of confounding bias (that is, when there's the possibility of the distortion in the estimated effect due to the context) in evaluating the effect of a policy, we can use causal diagrams. With this tool, arbitrary non-parametric interactions between variables can be established. Causal diagrams are used to give formal semantics to models of *intervention*. This helps us to validate if the the available assumptions are enough to estimate a causal effect. So, when a direct cause of the intervened variables is observable, it tells us that it is possible to construct the probabilities of the postintervetion using the probabilities of the preintervention variables.

Calculus of intervention, derived from the use of causal diagrams, give us a syntatic method to verify the assumptions about the intervention and how they relate with observation. This is possible because this method uses inference rules and transforms them in other inference sentences that also involved the intervention and observation. Then, the problem of controlling confounding bias is solved using the back-door condition: a set of requirements that covariates need to meet in order to estimate the unbiased causal effect of a treatment. 

In the other hand, the problem to predict the effect of a treatment using non-experimental data (policy evaluation problem) can be solved using the *do calculus* and its graphical criteria. The intervention effect of a non-experiment can be estimated when the data is supplemented with a causal diagram that is acyclic and contains no latent variables. In order with this, it concludes that a policy evalution problem is "unsolvable" if it can't be represented in an identifying graph or representation of causal assumptions.
