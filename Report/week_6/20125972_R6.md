### Chapter three: Causal Diagrams and the indentification of casual effects

This paper will explore ways to inferences casual relationships from a combination of data and assumptions qualities casual. Looking at these assumptions is or is not enough to evaluate the force of causal effects since nonexperimental data. Mayor idea is to explain cause-effect relationships, though exists some points to division. But, the author follows details about the causal inferences by the combination of assumptions, experiments and data. 

First, causal diagrams are important to predict the systems that could respond to a hypothetic intervention, not only related to probabilities but define causal relationships. It can help to develop probabilities preintervention and pro-intervention. Causal diagrams are acyclic and do not have latent variables. Also, to make causal identifications relationships. After that, it continues making definitions about de many probabilities of interventions without some observations, and develop with a specific group of observation Xs to explain Y. Determinating the impact of direct causes and diagrams in the variables and make estimation.

The control of the confidence is interesting, because we note the effect of variable into another from the adjusted and standardized measure by another variations variables. And find the main criterio is useful to decide appropiates variable's for adjusment. The article mentions the back-door criterions and the front-door criterion.

Finally, it explains about casually interprete structured tree plots. Their analysises and resultsa about Robin's research.
