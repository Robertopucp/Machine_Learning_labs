# Causal Diagrams and the Identification of Causal Effects


### 20172574

In chapter 3, the author presents the method through which cause-effect relationships can be correctly performed, as well as derive causal inferences and the ramifications of the assumptions to be made.

Thus, causal effects allow us to predict how a system would respond to a hypothetical intervention. In order to understand the concept of intervention more easily, the author introduces the concept of causal diagrams. This method will allow us to work with non-experimental data and will allow us to correctly identify causal relationships and causal effects.

An important aspect within the calculation of causal quantities is the Identifiability, as it allows us to estimate the causal effect of a model consistently even though it is not fully specified.
Likewise, causal diagrams can be used to solve the problem of cofounding bias, which allows us to standardize our measurements in the face of possible variations of other variables. This problem can be solved through two criteria: The back-door criterion and the front-door criterion. The first criterion is a graphical test that uses a causal diagram to check whether a set of variables (Z) is sufficient to identify the causal effect, for which two conditions must be met: no node in Z is a descendant of Xi and Z blocks every path between Xi and Xj that contains an arrow into Xi. The second criterion is used when the variables Z do not meet the conditions of the first criterion, however, they do serve to obtain a consistent estimate of the causal effect. To use this criterion three conditions must be satisfied: Z intercepts all directed paths from X to Y, there is no unblocked back-door path from X to Z and all back-door path from Z to Y are blocked by X.
