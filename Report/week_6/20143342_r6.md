This chapter on causal diagrams and identification of causal effects explores ways of inferring causal relationships from qualitative data and assumptions, deciding whether they are sufficient when obtained from non-experimental data. The aim is to describe cause-effect relationships, to clarify the divisions of these assumptions, and to construct causal inferences from the combination of assumptions, experiments and data. Thus, causal diagrams are used to give formality to the notion of intervention, whether in cases of policy decisions or for day-to-day activities. Now, it should be noted that estimates of causal effects from non-experimental data can be made if complemented with a causal diagram that is acyclic and does not contain latent variables. If some variables are not measured in the model, identifiability problems may arise. Also, the calculation of interventions is a tool that arises from the graphical analysis of causal effects, consisting of a set of inference rules that provides a syntactic method to obtain arguments about interventions and their interactions. In this way, a set of appropriate covariates can be determined, the measures to be found in the causal pathways can be dealt with, and measures can be negotiated.

One of the points to be highlighted in the chapter is the advantage of the augmented network representation in that it can be applied to any change in a deterministic function. Such as the author Kevin Hoover, who used the invariant characteristics to determine the direction of causal influences between certain variables, such as employment and money supply, and to observe sudden changes in the processes produced in these variables. Mention is also made of the conditioning operator, whose purpose is to eliminate spurious correlations between cause and effect. This is not introduced as a corrective adjustment to suppress spurious correlations, but emerges from the principle of preserving all the invariant information that the pre-intervention distribution may provide. With these first observations, it is implied that a diagram with direct causes of the intervening variables is observable and can allow the estimation of the impact of interventions in a passive way (non-experimental observations).

Another point to be highlighted is the control of the confidence sessions, since when evaluating the effect of one factor on another, it is important to know whether the measures should be adjusted or standardized in the face of possible variations in some other factors, known as covariates or confounding factors. This adjustment suggests dividing the data population into homogeneous groups related to these covariates in order to reevaluate the effect mentioned initially in each group and average the results. The question arises when trying to find which criterion needs to be used to decide which variables are appropriate for adjustment, among which we have the back-door criterion and the front-door criterion. The criteria are used for the example of smoking and its correlation with lung cancer explained by a type of cancer genotype involving an innate craving for nicotine. Although the data found are unrealistic and support such a hypothesis, the aim was to demonstrate the reasonableness of qualitative assumptions about the functioning of the mechanisms, together with non-experimental data to produce accurate quantitative assessments of causal effects.

The analyses proposed in the chapter are also related to Robins' G-estimation and casually interpreted structured tree plots. The author was able to note that Neyman's counterfactual notation served as a general mathematical language for causal inference and used it for a treatment model to studies with direct and indirect effects and time-varying treatments, covariates, and outcomes. Thus, what is presented in the chapter supports from a new viewpoint the structural analysis of Robins' theory. On the technical side, it offers systematic ways of modeling where Robins' initial assumption does not apply. On the conceptual side, the structural framework means moving from the vocabulary of independent counterfactuals to processes and mechanism, where human knowledge is encoded. In doing so, Robins' research has shown that the condition of ignorability is necessary to adequately handle time-varying treatment problems.
