<p style='text-align: justify;'> This chapter uses graphics, called causal diagrams, to derive explicit mathematical formulas to estimate the causal effect of an intervention (treatment) using nonexperimental data in a nonparametric framework. The author demonstrates that causal diagrams are powerful mathematical tools for identifying causal effects. 

<p style='text-align: justify;'> The chapter starts by giving an agricultural simple example where the soil fumigant is the treatment or intervention, the oat crop yields is the outcome and the eelworm population is a covariate. Then this example is illustrated in a causal diagram which represents the researcher's understanding and allows to derive a causal effect analysis only using the diagram. In other words, causal diagrams are used to give formal semantics to models of intervention. This helps us to validate if the available qualitative assumptions (researcher’s knowledge) are enough to estimate a causal effect (effect of X on Y). So, when a direct cause of the intervened variables is observable, it tells us that it is possible to construct the probabilities of the postintervention using the probabilities of the preintervention variables.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Nevertheless, in causal studies is always necessary to ask for the covariates since these affect the treatment effect estimation, so control the confounding bias is an essential task. In this way, this chapter presents the back-door criterion and front-door criterion as solutions to the selection of the adjusted variables. On one hand, the back-door criterion is a graphical test that asses if a set of variables (Z)  is sufficient for identifying causal effects. Z satisfies this criterion relative to an ordered pair of variables (Xi, Xj) in a graph if: (i) no node in Z is a descendant of Xi and (ii) Z blocks every path between Xi and Xj that contains an arrow into Xi. On the other hand, the front-door criterion demonstrates that covariates affected by the treatment can be useful for causal inference, but need several adjustments. These tests were illustrated in the smoking and genotype theory example. 

<p style='text-align: justify;'> In the graphical analysis framework, the calculus of intervention arises as a powerful tool, this sets several inference rules, known as “do calculus”, in order to facilitate a syntactic derivation of claims about interventions. This mathematical approach helps to select the set of covariables to control the unconfoundedness bias. Additionally, causal diagrams that can be identified implies that their assumptions allow the identification of causal effect, however nonidentifying causal diagrams can’t be solved.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Personally, I found the use of causal diagrams interesting as tools to know the effects of treatments, but more than that was the compression of the diagrams in a mathematical language that gave precision to the causal analysis. In addition to theoretical development, I find this tool useful in policy decision-making contexts, as it helps to predict the effects of interventions.
