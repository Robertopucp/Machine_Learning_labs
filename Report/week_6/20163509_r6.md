<p style='text-align: justify;'>Today, and in most of the world, there is a large amount of data on various topics or interests. This event has raised the exploration, creation or popularization of old or new estimation and prediction tools. The same thing happens with approaches or ideas, even those that had been discarded or forgotten. Judea Pearl writes the book "Causality" in 2000 where he presents and analyzes causality. This text was fundamental for the bases of the current debate on causal inference in various areas of research. In Chapter 3, he presents an important tool: Causal diagrams.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>This chapter has three general objectives: to enable researchers to convey qualitative assumptions about cause-effect relationships, to elucidate the ramifications on those assumptions, and to derive inferences from a combination of assumptions, experiments, and data. With the main task of identifying whether the given assumptions are sufficient to assess the intensity of the causal effects from non-experimental data. These effects allow us to predict the response of systems to hypothetical interventions, such as political decisions or actions taken in daily activity. However, estimating this effect can be very difficult. The author points out that this fact can be very easy to understand through a classic example from Cochran. For example, we want to estimate the effect of soil fumigants on the yield of oat crops. This research can be complicated by the fact that randomized controlled studies are infeasible and the presence of confounding bias. The latter interferes with the evaluation of the effects of the treatment regardless of the sample size. In addition, the bird population may be influential and not controlled within the investigation. So there would be an identification problem.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Due to these problems the author presents the causal diagrams. These are a graphical mathematical tool that allows us to formalize the intervention relationships between the variables to be considered. The links in the diagram are of two types: those that emanate from unmeasured quantities are designated with dashed arrows, those that connect measured quantities with solid arrows. The substantive assumptions incorporated in the diagram are negative causal statements that are conveyed through the missing links in the diagram. It is hoped that this tool will allow the researcher to mathematically identify whether the selected covariates are sufficient to control for confounding control problems, deal with measurements that are in the causal pathways, and exchange one set of measurements for another. Furthermore, the diagrams allow, through simple tests, to estimate whether the assumptions used are sufficient to identify causal effects. Likewise, the author presents other tools, although the diagrams differ by the method of analysis. Diagrams allow arbitrary causal relationships.
<p style='text-align: justify;'>On the other hand, it is important to note that the author the various concepts and theorems with the mathematical formalism. Therefore, it is an important contribution to the theoretical framework for various investigations. Likewise, he presents various examples that can help to understand these concepts. On the other hand, the task of text compression can be tedious due to mathematical formalism.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>In summary, in this chapter the causal diagram tool is presented, its purpose, objective and methodology are presented. Various problems and presentation of important concepts are covered.
