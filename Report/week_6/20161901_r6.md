## Paper: Pearl, Judea. Causal Diagrams and the Identification of Causal Effects
### Name: Alexander Pacheco (20161901)

The author aims to present the using of causal diagrams when we are dealing with confounding bias, which means that the context affect the estimated effect.

The main strength of the paper is that it presents a non-parametric method for causal inference. The author provides us with tool to determine if causal inference can be made from nonexperimental data. Furthermore, the author finds sollution for confounding bias testing his method. This means that the do-calculus is enough to solve the problem of policy evaluation.
However, one weakness of the paper is that their results are based on some assumptions and these are not observable in real data.
