## Causal Diagrams and the Identification of Causal Effects

## Student: Franco Caceres Vasquez

This chapter explore and detail how we can infer causal relationships from a combination of data and some causal assumptions. More specifically, this chapter try to show us how we can use causal diagrams to determinate whether the causal assumptions we elaborate are sufficient to identify causa effects or not and how we can use this same model (causal effect) to trade one set of measurements from another one.

 One of the points that can be highlighted in this chapter is that it is very detailed about the mathematic explication of all the process of how we should raise the problem and equations to know how to apply causal diagrams to determinate causal relationships. 

Another important point to be highlighted is the simple examples that are easy to understand in this chapter, such as the example of the experiment od the soil fumigants (X) that is used to increase are used to increase oat crop yields (Y) by controlling the eelworm population (Z). This example is pretty easy to understand and show us the problem that can arise when we are trying to assess the total effect fumigating on yield and how we can solve these problems through causal diagrams.

This is a really good article but it would be better if the authors could add some examples of how we can code this model with casual diagrams in some languages programs, such as R or Phyton.
