Estimation and Inference of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (Random Forests)

-----

Well it talks about the problems estimates of heterogeneous treatment some authors use methods such as kernel but the problem persists in this article they mention the causal forest method to solve this problem this is based on having a previous work to depress Random forest but with some adjustments that allows perform better. The question is whether this forest method is better than others in dealing with the heterogeneous effects of treatment.

To give validity to the myth of the forest the author first explains the theoretical basis the components of the alcoholism Random forest literature And the construction inside it also without experiments to make sure of its performance what is found that the causal Forest has a Mc lower and the confidence interval compared to another model such as K-NN, which generates a first step in search of the best model.

Some problems that the method presents is at the time of partitioning the data and what would be the optimal scale of the subsamples
