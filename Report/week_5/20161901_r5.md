## Paper: Stefan Wager and Susan Athey (2018) *Estimation and Inference of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects using Random Forests Econometric models*
### Name: Alexander Pacheco (20161901)

The authors develop a method to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects through a nonparametric causal forest. Their results allow any random forest to be used for statistical inference. 

One of the strengths of the paper is that their theoretical approach forms a solid  basis for the author's argument. Furthermore, they also compares their method with classic methods such as nearest-neighbor matching obtaining fewer mean square errors, which shows that their method fits better the data. However, the weakness of the paper, from my point of view, is the simulated data used in the article. Although its use simplifies the task of building a new method, it must be tested on real data.

The main contribution of the paper, as the authors mentioned, is the developing of an asymptotic normality theory that allows to do statistical inference using random forest. Then, the next steps are to test the method with real data and pay attention to how it performs.
