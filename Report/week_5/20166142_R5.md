<p style='text-align: justify;'> Understanding treatment effect heterogeneity is helpful in different fields such as medicine, marketing, engineering, economics, among others. However, the data size used to significantly explore treatment effect heterogeneity with traditional methods (such as nearest-neighbor matching, Kernel methods, among others) was small, as well as the number of covariates employed. In addition, there were restrictions in the procedure that could make it difficult to uncover strong but unexpected heterogeneity of the treatment effect.  Due to this problem, the authors propose a nonparametric "casual forest" method for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation focusing on the family of random forest algorithms introduced by Breiman. Random forest algorithms allow the use of iterations in high dimensions compared to classical nonparametric estimation approaches that did not work well on many covariates.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>To analyze whether the nonparametric causal forest method is appropriate for causal inference, the authors explain that the estimator obtained should be consistent with an asymptotically normal sampling distribution. So, the researcher can use it to test the hypothesis tested and establish valid confidence intervals. First, the authors develop conceptual tools such as random forests, honest trees, causal trees, and forests and explain how to construct them. Secondly, they performed simulation experiments that obtained that causal forests have a lower mean square error than K-NN matching. Another result is that in terms of uncertainty quantification, the causal forests obtained a higher nominal coverage than the other methods; even so, after a certain point, the performance of the confidence intervals decreases. 

A limitation is that the authors do not explain the optimal scale of the subsample size $s_n$ to minimize the mean square error of the random forests, so it would be interesting to advance in this step in future research. Another limitation of the study is that they do not explain how to choose the appropriate procedure for data partitioning, i.e., whether to use double-sample forests or propensity score forests. Following this line of work, it would also be useful if the results provide pointwise confidence intervals for the treatment effect, $\tau(x),$ and extend the authors' theory to a global functional estimation . In addition, it would be promising to propose an approach that trims the bounds of the feature space support and possibly correct the bias, which would improve the coverage of the confidence intervals.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>From the technical point of view, the contribution of the article is the proposal of the asymptotic normality theory that allows statistical inferences to be made using random forest predictions that are asymptotically unbiased and Gaussian. Another important contribution is the extension to causal forests proposed by the authors. These contributions are important because they complement the scarce literature developed in this line of work, which lacks formal statistical inference results because of lack of consistency or bias.
