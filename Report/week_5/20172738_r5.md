In the fields of medicine, marketing, engineering, economics and other there have been a constant problem in some estimations: heterogeneous treatment effects. Some author use other methods to mitigate this problem (KNN, Kernel methods,) but the problem still persist. The authors of the research explain their powerful method "Causal Forest" for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation. This method is based on the previously work of randon forest by Breima but with some adjusment that the author made to improve their performance and to the specific problem of the mentioned fields. The main questions of the paper is if this new method is better among other to the problem of heterogeneous treatment effects.

To answer this question, the author first, explain all the theoretical base of the model, explaining the components of the algorith. Also this theoretical base deeps in the literature of the randon forest, honest trees and explain their inner construction. In the second part, the author develop some experiments to measure the performance of the causal forest with other models. In these experiments, the causal forest have a lower MSE in compare with the K-nearest neighbor. This results prove in some way the idea of the authors and the improve of their model in the field.

The main limitation, and the author mentioned, is poor explanation of the process of procedure for data partitioning. Also the author do not explain about the optimal scale of the subsample size. This mentioned topics are very important to measure the real performance of the Causal forest. His omission rest credibility to the authors and is the week part of the paper, even if the theoretical part and the experiments has positive results.

I think that this article is a step forward in the use of the random forest in other fields like medicine and marketing to mitigate the treatment effect. The next step is to keep applying the causal forest to differents fields to track the performance of the model in differect situations and fields.
