In this article, they develop a nonparametric causal forest for heterogeneous estimates. This is because there is currently a large amount of data; furthermore, the precision of the estimate is needed for a group of individuals. The results of the estimates may contain external effects, so the heterogeneity may be completely false. Thus, subgroups must be specified to be analyzed, which makes estimation difficult. However, it addresses the development of a powerful non-parametric method for estimating the effect of heterogeneous treatment.

The article is in charge of describing the causal forests. They explain step by step how to develop the model and what in specific cases it should be used. Finally, the authors show specific results of confidence intervals, for which the model has the power to increase its application in other situations.
