#### Article: Estimation and Inference of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects using Random Forests
#### Author: Stefan Wager and Susan Athey
<p style='text-align: justify;'>There is a problem when exploring different treatments and their effects in subgroups, and it is that there is the possibility that these subgroups present extreme effects, where randomness and heterogeneity would have vain results. In science, as in medicine and economics, subgroups are analyzed to avoid the problem previously described, however, these procedures (post-randomization analysis of the subgroups) could make it difficult to find unexpected treatment effect. Taking these limitations into account, the article develops a forest-based method for treatment effect estimation that allows for a tractable asymptotic theory and valid statistical inference.<p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>Regarding the strengths of the article, It proposes non-parametric methods that allow not wasting data (loosing the test data in every split), also maintaining the benefits of the classic models, achieving much smaller mean squared errors than the classic methods and having data of any size as well as with a long or small number of covariates. As for the weakness of the paper,it has not developed a systematic form of "trimming", which improves the coverage of the intervals, nor does it place greater emphasis on prediction than on the causality of the variables. <p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>As the authors themselves said in the article "the main contribution of this article is an asymptotic normality theory that allows us to do statistical inference using random forest predictions", this technical tool, resolve the problems raised at the beginning of this report.  <p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>As for the next steps that have to take into account,well i really dont know. <p>
