###  Estimation and Inference of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects using Random Forests
#### By: Elizabeth Nicole Linares Camus

In many fields, such as medicine and economics, scientists study the casual effect of a treatment. In general, most of the data set haven’t been long enough to estimate the heterogenous effect of a treatment. But now, there are more tools to try to estimate these effects. Yet, there’s a fear that some researchers highlight only the subgroups with extreme effects and have, consequently, spurious heterogeneity. That’s why, the authors, to try to defeat this problem, develop a nonparametric casual forest method for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation. 

This method follows the random forest algorithms that was first introduced by Breiman (2001). A strength of this method is that it keeps achieving an asymptotically normal and unbiased estimation, this with a valid interval confidence. Also, when using “honest trees” (this constructed by double-sample trees or propensity trees), the authors can solve the problem of selecting bias in this adaptive method. 

To prove that the method is more efficient than other classical methods (k-nearest neighbor matching), especially when there’s a larger number of covariates, make a simulation experiment comparing both methods. The result of this comparison is that the casual forest beats the k-nearest method in respect of variance and bias, obtaining a better mean-squared error.

Yet, there are some things that needs to improve with this method. For instance, in the simulation experiment they manually choose between double-sample forest or propensity forest, so in the future will be better if there’s a mechanism that allows us to choose the best way to construct an honest tree.
