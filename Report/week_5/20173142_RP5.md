## Report 5- Estimation and Inference of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects using Random Forests

The main objective of this paper is to address the challenge of procedural constraints which can make difficult to discover strong but unexpected heterogeneity of treatment effect. To do this, a powerful, nonparametric method for heteroge neous treatment effect estimation that yields valid asymptotic confidence intervals for the true underlying treatment effect is developed.

One of the strengths of this paper is the way in which it addresses the problem of heterogeneous treatment effect estimation. This paper attempts to address the limitations of previous models and to improve on them. For that purpose, the author develops a forest based method for treatment effect estimation that allows for a tractable asymptotic theory and valid statistical inference, this algorithm is called "causal forest".

One of the contributions of this paper is the ability to try to propose a nonparametric methods for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation that allow for data driven feature selection all while maintaining the benefits of classical methods, that is, asymptotically normal and unbiased point estimates with valid confidence intervals.

One of the next steps of this paper, and as the author mentions, is to be able to quantify the selection bias. New methods should focus on trying to solve this problem, using previous works and employing new estimation methods and also implement improvements to old methods.
