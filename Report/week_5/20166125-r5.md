# Estimation and Inference of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects using Random Forests

## Student: Franco Caceres Vasquez

The authors Stefan Wager and Susan Athey develop a class of nonparametric methods to estimate heterogenous treatment effect, which is understood as a difference between two potential outcomes. Specifically, this is a nonparametric causal forest can be thought as a kind of nearest neighbor method that maintain the asymptotic properties such as asymptotically normal and unbiased point estimates with valid confidence intervals. Having said this, it is obvious that the research question of this article would be if there are any kind of nonparametric method that are more powerful than classical methods based on nearest-neighbor matching. 

Some strengths that can be highlighted in this article are the well detailed explanation of how we can do our regression trees and how we can interpret the asymptotic Inference with Causal Forests. It is also quite impressive how the authors are, as they said, the first who develop a set of results that allow any type of random forest to be used for provably valid statistical inference. However, there are also a clear weakness on this article and that is the lack of empirical applications of this method to show as results, where they compare and show the benefits of this causal forest method from other ones. 

The main contribution of this article to the research question and to the causal inference field is the asymptotic normality theory that follows from that nonparametric causal forest developed that enable us to do statistical inference using random forest predictions. 

Something that can be taken into account and can be a next step for this article is that the authors can add more empirical application and perhaps they could add a section that shows in which fields  and how these models can be used in different sectors, especially in economics, as was done in the reading of the previous report.
