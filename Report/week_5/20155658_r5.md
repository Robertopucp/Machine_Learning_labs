Nowadays, the use of linear, logistic regressions, decision trees, neural networks and so on have become very popular and useful due to great advances in computational and statistical matters. Many of these models have made advances in medicine, statistics, economics, sociology, psychology and many other fields. Thus, it is essential to make every each model  as effective as possible in order to improve future findings in the different fields of science. One of those methods used in order to make them more effective is random forests, which in the empirical field -so far- is the one that has had the best results. Next, the article “Estimation and inference of effects of heterogeneous treatments using random forests” by Wager, S., & Athey, S.

First, I will begin by stating the goal of the authors' research. The authors try to answer the question: Should random forests be used as an inference method to understand the heterogeneity of the treatment effect?

Secondly, I will highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the article's approach to answer the question.

On the one hand, one of the strengths of the article is that, above all, it provides an extended way the use of statistical theory (bias, honesty, asymptotic normality, asymptotic theory), machine learning (tree regressions, causal inference with causal forests) and empirical results through simulations and contrast with the nearest neighbors method to prove that the tree-based method for treatment effect is an adequate method to capture its heterogeneity.

On the other hand, one of the weaknesses of the article is that they manually chose simulations in the experiments: whether use double-sample forests or forest propensity, depending on which procedure is most appropriate in each problem environment (matching method with the nearest neighbor and random forests). So, in a certain way, there would not be -somehow- a serious scientific research.

Thirdly, the main contribution of this article is the formulation of an asymptotic normality theory that allows to do statistical inferences using random forest predictions, corroborated theoretically (statistics and machine learning) and empirically (previous studies, experiments and contrast with the closest neighbor match method).

Finally, an important challenge for future work would be to design purely random methods -and not manually chosen simulations: whether to use double sample forests or propensity forests- to validate in a better way the use of random forests in the heterogeneous treatment effects. Therefore, another valuable step for future work would be to design division rules that can automatically choose which characteristic of the training data should be splitted in order to reduce bias and allow trees to focus on characteristic values ​​of greater importance.
