# Report 4: Estimation and Inference of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects using Random Forests

Stefan Wager & Susan Athey (2018) search to answer how forest causal tree can estimate the heteregenous treatment effects that meets asymtotic properties such as consistency and asymptotic normality. They present a variant of regression forest that generates multiple trees that satisfy the property of "honesty" (which, is basically using differente samples for training and prediction exercises). With this, they find the heteregeouns effects in each leaf of the forest causal tree. They also proof that this properties are also important for prediction because this variation allows for better perfomance even with more covariates. 

The strenght of this paper is how it constructs the forest causal tree from other forest methods that have proven to be effective under certain limitations, allowing us to keep the advantages from it. Parting from Athey and Imbels (2016), they construct a causal "honest" tree that calcultes the confidence intervals for average treatment effects for each leaf. However, they solve the asymtotical problem by using the heuristically motivated infinitesumal jackknife developed by Wager, Hastie, and Efron (2014). This is an excelent precedent to construct other forest methods that could be used for something other that prediction. 

Nevertheless, the paper has its own limitations. As the authors mention, this is an introductory paper that brings tools to identify other methods that have accurate covariance estimates in more difficult situations, such as when we have very small samples. Also, and probably more important, it only proves accuracy for confidence intervals of the true effect. This reduces the importance of the paper since , mostly, investigators or policy-makers are more interested in the exact value of the effect in subgroups. 

Overall, this paper advanced knowledge since it proves an asymptotic normality theory that allows to do statistical inference using random forest predictions because it makes the effects estimates asymptotically unbiased and Gaussian. This advance has not been made before (or so the authors tell us) and allows to see the forest methods as tools for asymptotuc analysis.  Apart from that, the paper could be improved (or, more precisely, extended). How to use this method in more tricky situations, as well as how to extent this to a global functional estimation is work to be done in the future in order to take advantage of this development.
