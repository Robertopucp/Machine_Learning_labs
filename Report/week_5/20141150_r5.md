<p style='text-align: justify;'> In the past, there have been some hurdles to exploring heterogeneous treatment effects either because of the small datasets, the bias on researchers to select an ideal subgroup, or even because of procedural restrictions. In response, Wager and Athey develop a powerful nonparametric causal forest for estimating heterogeneous effects that yield asymptotic confidence intervals for the true treatment effects. Along with the article, they try to show that their method it's power and is also compared to others. In this way, the question of this research, taking into consideration all the literature about heterogeneous treatment effects, could be: is the nonparametric causal forests method a useful and powerful tool to estimate the heterogeneity of the treatment effect?

<p style='text-align: justify;'> To answer this question,  this article makes an extended theoretical analysis which details each component of the method as the consistency and asymptotic normality theory for the random forest, the causal forest algorithm in the potential outcome framework with unconfoundedness to achieve consistency and estimating heterogeneous treatment effects using random forests. This extensive theoretical development in an orderly manner is one of the strengths of the research, as it allows us to understand the methodology of the theoretical proposal and its construction. Another strength is that the authors conclude the research comparing the performance of the causal forest algorithm against classical k-nearest neighbor matching using simulations where the causal forest is better in terms of bias and variance, this exercise makes the proposal stronger. 

<p style='text-align: justify;'> In contrast, a limitation of the study is that there is a lack of explanation about the procedure rules for sample splitting, deficiency that the authors themselves acknowledge and leave pending further research. Another possible disadvantage that has nothing to do with the research approach is that some sections are difficult to understand, but the main idea can be understood.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> On the other hand, the main contribution of the article is the capacity to use statistical inference using random forest predictions in the framework of asymptotic normality theory. In addition, another important contribution is, using random forest theory, the causal forest algorithm which is conformed of causal trees that estimate the treatment effect at the leaves of the tree.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Finally, the next step for this research could be to make empirical applications, either for economics, medicine, engineering, and so on, of the proposal and compare it with other methods and work on complex splitting rules of the dataset.
