## What is the research question of the article?
The paper aims to answer wheter a Random forest method can be used in  a heterogeneous treatment context to make inference. Therefore the question is:
* Random forest can be used to make causal inference of heterogeneous treatments?


## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering that question?

Since it's been published in a Statistics Journal it is expected to find a complex notation and theory. However the paper does a great work explaining Random Forest methods almost from zero. It certainly turns hard to read in some parts but the main idea remains (kind of) clear. 

The fact that the paper mentions $R$ packages it's also interesting and helpful.

## How does this document advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided to publish the article.)

The paper proposes methods for heterogeneous treatment effects estimations. This methos can be thought as a n nearest neighbor approach for Random Forest. Note that nearest neighbor matching methods are widely used in the econometric literature to estimate treatment effects. 

The paper finds that this new approaches estimate more precise results over conventional $k-NN$ mathcing approaches which seem more biased. 
 
## What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to move forward on this question?

Splitting rules should be improved. The paper choses the splitting rules in a very primitive way, the document mentions that the next step to improve this methods is to design complex splitting rules that can automatically choose
which characteristic of the training data to split on.
