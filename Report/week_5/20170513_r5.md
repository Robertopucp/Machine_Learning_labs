In their paper, Wager and Athey seek to develop a method for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects using a causal forest. As they highlight, their main objective is to develop a random forest that works for observing unexpected treatment effects (effectively solving the limitations of traditional empirical methods), but with confidence intervals that allow for valid causal inference. For the latter, they develop an asymptotic normality theory.

This work takes a mainly theoretical approach. In doing so, the authors present a solid framework for the method they introduce. They also test the performance of random forests against a more widely used method, nearest-neighbor matching, in a controlled experiment, which further proves the validity of the presented work. This methodology, however, has drawbacks. First, the terminology, and overall presentation of the random forests, make the work difficult to understand, at times inaccessible, without an understanding of causal trees and forests. Second, it is unknown how the method would perform outside a controlled experiment, and requires further empirical testing.

The main contribution, as the authors point out, is the asymptotic normality theory, which allows for the determination of confidence intervals, and therefore valid causal inferece, in the cases of methods such as random forests. This allows the method to be potentially useful with larger sets of data given the adaptive nature of the approach.

The next step, as discussed before, is to apply the method with real-life data, and see how it performs, especially given the numerous conditions stated by the authors. It would also be interesting to see how such models perform with smaller samples.
