In the article, the authors seek to address the challenge of imposed procedural restrictions when exploring heterogeneous effects due to their limitations. For this, it uses the development of a non-parametric method with high power to estimate the effect of the heterogeneous treatment (causal forests), which produces valid asymptotic confidence intervals for the true effect of the underlying treatment. In that sense, its main objective is to develop a random forest that works to observe unexpected effects of the treatment. For this, the limitations are addressed so that random forests are useful for causal inference.

Regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the document, it could be pointed out that the theoretical approach about the method that they are developing as a positive aspect in the sense that it provides a solid basis for the development of its objective. On the other hand, the authors do not explain how to partition the data in such a way that it is the most appropriate, this as a disadvantage.

The authors explicitly mention that the main contribution of the paper is an asymptotic normality theory that allows statistical inferences using random forest predictions.

Finally, within the next steps to be taken, the authors mention that the results offer specific confidence intervals, so the theory could be extended to global functional estimates. They also mention that a systematic approach could help correct for confidence intervals by correcting for bias.
