## Estimation and Inference of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects using Random Forests
#### S. Wager & S. Athey

In this article, the authors have developed a particular non-parametric method for the heterogeneous estimation of the treatment effect that allows associating the selection of characteristics for the data. Provides valid asymptotic confidence intervals for the true treatment effect and a valid statistical inference. The authors follow the proposal of Athey and Imbens that the forestry method is composed of casual trees that estimate the effect of the treatment on the leaves of the trees, which they will name: casual forest. Its results are constant and normal asymptotic, which is useful in pure prediction contexts.

For the authors, the casual forest is better than a highly optimized single tree in reducing variance and smoothing the boundary. The honest tree or forest does not look good to them, because they waste half of the training data at each step. But they discuss how useful it might be to specify estimates of the effect of forest structure and treatment. Next, they explain that the forest has an average of trees of independent generation, the bias of the forest will be the same as the bias of a single tree, although due to the asymptotic normality they establish lower limits to increase the regression trees, they become weak predictors incrementals Incremental sets from T to 1 by subsampling, using ANOVA decomposition and establishing an infinitesimal razor consistency for random forests.

In the end, they show us simulation experiments and treat the estimation of heterogeneous effects, the results say that it is a good performance, especially when "d" is small, because it explains the dependence of the variance of the trees and its correlation.
