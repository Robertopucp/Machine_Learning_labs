When looking for heterogeneous treatment effects, spurious heterogeneity can be incurred, or the same demanding treatment procedures can lead to unexpected treatment effect heterogeneity. Therefore, the paper seeks to develop a nonparametric method for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation that yields valid asymptotic confidence intervals for the true treatment effect.

A strength of the article is that they develop step by step the method they propose and explain its theoretical basis as well as their contributions for each topic. In addition, they develop simulation experiments, which allow them to test their method and compare it with the standard k nearest neighbors(k-NN) matching procedure. In the first experiment they show that casual forests are an improvement over k-NN matching, because they present lower mean-squared error and lower confidence intervals when there is an interaction between e(x) and m(x). Also, in the second experiment (m(x)=0 and e(x)=0.5) they find that casual forest is still a better method than k-NN matching.

Because the development of the asymptotic of random forests is very incipient, the authors bridge this gap by providing a forest-base method for treatment effect estimation based on asymptotic theory and valid statistical inference. They are also the first to present a set of conditions (regularity assumptions and unconfoundedness) that allow the predictions made by random forests to be both asymptotically unbiased and Gaussian, which allows classical statistical tests to be performed.  

An important step to develop is to improve the design of the splitting rules, which will allow reducing the bias, precisely this was one of the limitations of the simulation performed by the authors Wager and Athey (2018). Likewise, it is important to develop an automatic rule to select S .
