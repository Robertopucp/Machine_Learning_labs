# Double/debiased machine learning for treatment and structural parameters

Report 9

This paper analyzes the classic problem that occurs in semi-parasimetric problems in low-dimensional parameters in the presence of other high-dimensional parameters. To solve the problem, the author first raises basic methods, but with some changes, such as not having a high dimension. They do this so that it does not limit the complexity of the model. Also, how innovative they incorporate a set of resulting Double ML or Faded (DML) methods. They provide point estimators that are concentrated on a group of the true values ​​of the parameters and are approximately unbiased and normally distributed. This allows them to construct valid trust statements.

All this is developed step by step in the paper. They explain how the results are obtained and for which cases they will serve us. Also, in the final part they mention some previous works to strengthen his new proposals, see how the studies have progressed to solve these problems and give additional knowledge. Finally, the paper fulfills its objectives of explaining everyone about how to solve the problem.
