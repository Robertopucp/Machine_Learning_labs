The article explains us about to make double/debiased machine learning relative to treatment and structural parameters, first they said that parameter of ML classic could be omit bias, specifically the parameter of theta. They will mention some specific characteristic that it would make a efficient estimator. Overcoming regularization biases using orthogonalization and the role of sample splitting are important to build a well estimation errors.

Both ways are important to catch well the histogram of the distribution, the classical method of ML without spliting sample and orthoganalization not catch the convergence of estimation errors. Next, they support by the method of Neyman Orthogonal Score to build a method with splitting sample in high dimensional sparse, because it helps them to control the effects of pollution by using several covariates. The problem to do that is efficient of scores, it's only using the log-likelihood functions, another problem is the restrictions or the nuisance parameters dimension.

After, they show examples to explain the methods with the next results, the effects of unemployment insurance bonus on unemploment duration are negative, the effect of eligibility and participation on net financial is smaller and the effects of institutions on economic growth is bigger and positive.
