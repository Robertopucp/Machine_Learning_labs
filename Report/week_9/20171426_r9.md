# Report 9: Double/debiased machine learning for treatment and structural parameters.
 
Chernozhukov et al (2017) presents us the double/debiased machine learning methods (MLD). This helps us make inference on the estimates of the controls ($\theta_i$) by removing the influence of the regulatization bias and overfitting related to the estimation of the effect of the treatment. This is dute to the estimation of the error function ($\eta_i$) using ML. This is made using the Neyman orthogonal moments that reduce the nuisance parameters and the using cross-fitting.

Finally, it shows 3 examples: the Pennsylvania Reemplyment Bonus experiment (we are familiaresed with this one), the effect of the 401(k) eligitility and the IV estimation of the effects of institutions on economics growth. This examples shows us how we can control confounding effects by a determinated number of variables with either of the ML methods used to estimate the nuisance functions, as well as the increase of the standard errors due to the uncertainty of the sample splitting. 


One of the strenghts of this paper is that it presents a method that allow us to use ML methods to estimate the impact of a treatment but at the same time to overcome the regularization bias using orthonalization and sample splitting. This paper, then, presents us to a method that is able to correct it's own flaws by using generic statistical theory and simple procedures, sush as sample splitting and cross-fitting. 

Nevertheless, the paper has its own limitations as well. In the 3 examples presented it is showned that the results estimated by the this MLD methods are similar to the ones that didn't use them. This makes us questions wheter this method - apart from integrating ML methods to the literature of impact evalution- adds to the estimation of the effects, which are the main objetive of its apÂ¿plication.

This paper advanced knowledge because it shows a plausible method that incorporates ML  to estimate the effects of a treatment and perfome inference on them.  Apart from that, the paper could be improved by highlighting the advantages this methods have in comparison with the ones used in the examples. For example, it can make more emphasis on the break of the assumptions of a lineal relationship between the dependent and independent variables.
