<p align="justify">The main goal of this paper is to offer a general and simple procedure for estimating and perform inference on  θ who is still valid in highly complex settings. To do so, the authors use examples of differents and complex setting, using technices like lasso and doble lasso to prove the efficience of the method. In the first example that the authors provide us (Partilally Linear Regresion), the result show us  the difference between the conventional along with double ML estimators (the benefit of orthogonalization) and the advantaje using random forest, preventing overfitting (in cross-fitting split sample).<br>

The strenght in the method provide by the authors (Neyman Orthogonal Score/Moment) relied in the sample splitting idea, in high dimensional sparse and where ML methods and sample splitting are use to control the effects of pollution by using several covariates. <br>
The weakness of the model, or the problem that the authors find while working with it are: the resulting score only efficient while the function is lof-likelihood, as well as the restrictions problems with infinite dimensional nuisance parameters. <br>
<br>	
But, without a doubt, the most enjoyable part of the paper is the empirical part of it. To ilustrate the methods developed, the authors use three examples that clarify the mathematical part, which can be a little bit confusing: The effects of unemployment insurance bonus on unemployment duration ( which it is negative), the effect of 401(k) eligibility and participation on net financial assets (much more smaller effect  than in the original work) and the effects of institutions on economic growth (large and positive effect, as expected). <br>
The choice of the ML method does not offer different results (as shown in the empirical part of the paper), instead provide more robustness to the results. </p>
