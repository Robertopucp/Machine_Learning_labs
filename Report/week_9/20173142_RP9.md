## Report 9: Double/debiased machine learning for treatment and structural parameters.

 The ‘double’ machine learning It’s one way to bring the power of machine learning for prediction on non-linear problems into an econometric context in which the asymptotic properties of the estimates of the parameters of interest are known to behave well. The double machine learning method of Chernozhukov et al. delivers point estimators that have a sqr(N) rate of convergence for N observations and are approximately unbiased and normally distributed. 

One of the strengths of this work is its usefulness for selecting unobservable objects with high dimensional confusion and the way in which this method uses a cross-fit to efficiently split the sample. In addition, this method functionally avoids strong assumptions. the ML bias and how we overcome it and try to correct the regularization bias with Neyman orthogonality.

One of the weaknesses  of this technique is that estimates of average treatment effects underneath exogeneity. These conditions could also be quite uncommon in health services, wherever unobserved unsupportive and omitted variable bias gift issues that are additional doubtless to be resolved through different applied mathematics approaches, together with instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, or longitudinal studies.
