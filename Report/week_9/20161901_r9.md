The objective developed by the authors in the paper is to show a method to estimate coefficients in very high-dimensional cases. To achieve this goal, they present different examples in which they test Machine Learning methods like random forest, lasso, post-lasso, regression trees, etc. Double Machine Learning seems to be the best way and, in addition, they use sample splitting to prevent overfitting.

The strength of the paper is that they support their method with the Neyman orthogonal scores in high-dimensional cases. In addition, as the authors mentioned, the main contribution is to offer a general and simple procedure for estimating and to perform inference in highly complex settings.

They also conclude that all the methods they used are able to find sufficiently high-quality approximations to the underlying nuisance functions and they remark the importance to use sample splitting and to prove that their estimates are robust.
