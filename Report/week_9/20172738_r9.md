The article aim to answer the classic sermi-parametric problem of inference on a low dimensional parameter $\theta_0$ and in a certain situation of hight dimensions. The   


The strenght of the article are the methods for the case. I mention this aspect because the author made an explanation of the especifict context of this treatment effeect and how the machine learning methods fit in this especic situation. I think that there is a rich background and arguments that can made a robust and well planned paper. Nevertheless, this is also the weak aspect of the paper. Maybe not a weak aspect indeed but the authors find in the process of the research that the score is only eddicient meanewhile the function is log-likelihood. I say that is not a weak aspect because is part of a research that in some cases the reality dont fit wiith the theoretical explanation.

The paper mare than a theoretical method, shows us some rich empirical examples using the method that the authors propose. The empirical examples are 3 cases with a broad types of methods like Lasso, Regression trees,Boosting, etc. This empirics examples shows the robustness of method proposed by the authors.

Finally, I think as in previous reports that the topic of treatments effects is an interesting fields where the is a lot to know and understand. This kind of articles aim to answer some problems related to that specific field and their aplication in real cases can answer and find solutions to real cases. This paper try that.
