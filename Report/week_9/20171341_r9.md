Chernozhukov et al (2018) aim to address procedures to estimate treatment effects in complex settings. Firstly, authors explain what is regularization bias and how it can (at least partially) solved using orthogonalization and it's features. Authors then remark how sample splitting can remove bias caused by overfitting. 

In the second part of the paper, authors introduce formally their proposal where they first propose the construction of orthogonal scores through different estimation methods (likelihood, gmm) and settings (infinite nuisance parameters). 


After a broad theoretical explanation authors show how how Debiased machine learning can guide to inference. The most relevant aprt is where authors mention that DML methods can be used when analyzing treatment effects even if the treatment was not randomly assigned. Three empirical examples are presented: The Pennsylvania reemployement bonus experiment, the 401(K) program and the famous paper of Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson (2001) about institutions effect on economic outcomes (IV context).


In the empirical application (which is the more intuitive part) authors use methods such as lasso, regression trees, random forests, Boosting, Ensemble and neural networks (excepting in the case of Institutions due to the sample size). Authors estimate the variance through two methods: adjusted and unadjusted median median SEs across splits. Conclusions doesn't change (insurance have a negative effect on unemployment duration; 401(k) elegibility and participation have a positive effect on assets and stronger institutions have positive effects on economic outcomes) but the estimations acquire more robustness.
