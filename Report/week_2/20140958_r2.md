This article tackles down the estimation and inference methods for high-dimensional sparse regression models (HDS). HDS refers to a situation where you have many regressors, $p$, which in many cases are more significant than the sample size, $n$. This situation usually leads to a sparse model. In the words of the authors, "sparsity can be motivated on economic grounds in situations where a researcher believes that the economic outcome could be well-predicted by a small (relative to the sample size)number of factors but is unsure about the identity of the relevant factors." However, identifying the right set of regressors and estimating their coefficients must be based on  $l_1$-penalization. In this vein, the article presents theoretical (models, theorems, conditions, and assumptions) and practical models to deal with HDS and $l_1$-penalization.

A strength of this article is its structure. It starts with a simple method, and then it moves to more complicated and sophisticated techniques such as Indirect Post-Lasso, Oracle, or Double Lasso. It also demonstrates theory with convenient examples of real life, making it a lot easier to understand. 

The main contribution to our career is a new way to estimate covariates in a data-rich context. Many regressors can be used without worrying too much about overfitting (thanks to regularization). Therefore, predictions could be more exact, opening a big room to explore.

Regarding the further research opportunities, while reading the article, I wondered how the â„“1-penalization can be employed to perform economic models rather than using an instrumental variables approach. Economic models can be a source to identifying which variables to consider to get the best right set of covariates. However, as the authors state, "an important problem in economics is the analysis of high-dimensional data in which there are many weak signals within the set of variables considered, in which case the sparsity assumption may provide a poor approximation."
