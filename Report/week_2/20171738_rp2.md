# INFERENCE FOR HIGH-DIMENSIONAL SPARSE ECONOMETRIC MODELS (A. BELLONI, V. CHERNOZHUKOV, AND C. HANSEN)
         

High-dimensional sparse models (HDS) arise situations in which many regressors (or series terms) are available and the regression function is well approximated by a parsimonious but unknown set of regressors. In other words, it consist in the situation where the researcher has access to data with a large number of covariates. The last condition makes it possible to estimate the complete regression function effectively by finding an approximately correct set of regressors.

Therefore, I would say that the question that this article tries to answer is the next one: ¿How good the estimation methods for HDS that make use of the penalty of $l_1$ could work? and ¿Which are the cases where the broad potential applicability of HDS conometry models and methods can be applied?

Also, I consider that the advantages of the article's approach are the follow ones: a) it considers a wide range of models, which makes posible to make clear the inicial hypothesis' clarity; b) it includes  mathematical description for each econometric model to be used and mention other authors who supported the econometric model that were mentioned in the work with their results in terms of robustness confidence intervals, etc. But I also consider that the disadvantages of the article's approach is that it does not develop the models deep enough, which mainly means that isn´t a deep description of data causal inference. From my point of view, this can make things harder for a non-expert person to fully understand the article's message.

So, about the contribution of the article, I would say that it mainly consist of the development not only of strument variables models or partially linear models, but of two empirical examples that can help the reader to understand better the possible usages of HDS. Besides that, another one could be that, through simulation ande empirical examples, the article finally demonstrate that ℓ1 penalization methods may be use fully employed in these models and can complement tools commonly employed by applied researchers.

Finaly, I would say that next steps that could be made following the course of this article is that - considering that the use of $l_1$-penalizarion is only one method of performing estimation with high-dimensional data- similar models used could be combined with other methods for estimating structural economic objects which also consider an efficient use of high-dimensional data cases.
