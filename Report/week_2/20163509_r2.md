<p style='text-align: justify;'> This article develops in a theoretical and empirical way (applied examples) the estimation and inference methods for the HDS models. These models are used in situations where there are many regressors available, but the regression function is very well approximated only by a subset of this group. These regressors are unknown, therefore the article presents various methods that seek to identify them and estimate their coefficient. All of these methods are based on the L1 penalty. These methods are developed consecutively (extensions of the first model) and the variants correspond to the implementation of various conditions that are met or not. The development is quite extensive in mathematics and a small example is given in each variant.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> It is important to mention that the article develops an extension in models with instrumental variables. These types of models are very common in the field of macro-econometrics and macroeconomics. Therefore, the article provides a theoretical framework and expansion for these models (with instrumental variables). Likewise, it develops a comparison between the estimated methods and shows the power of each of them under different conditions and which one is more appropriate to apply. The theoretical framework and review made by the article on methods based on the L1 penalty is important for future research, since, as mentioned, it summarizes and exposes (mathematically) these methods. Furthermore, it recognizes the need to explore other methods (e.g. Huang, Horowitz, and Ma (2008), Fan and Li (2001), Zhang (2010), Fan and Liao (2011)). Likewise, it raises a new line of investigation for the case where there is no independence between the results reported in the observations. Therefore, the development of estimation methods for HDS models based on L1 penalty (exploration for models with instrumental variables), the comparative analysis of the results of the methods and the suggestions for exploration of other methods and a possible line of research make up the main contribution of the article.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> On the other hand, the author presents each method, comparative analysis and conclusions very extensively in mathematics. This fact can be a significant challenge (even discouraging) for the reader, especially for those who do not have a solid background. So the article would not necessarily be useful to introduce you to the estimation methods in HDS. Despite presenting application examples, some of them are not necessarily easy to understand, due to their mathematical complexity. Therefore, the approach with extensive mathematical formality could be considered as both an advantage and a disadvantage of the article. Likewise, the exploration of this type of estimation methods is not as explored in the literature and they represent an important estimation option for researchers.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> As the author mentions, there are estimation methods that should be explored and new conditions that would be interesting to deal with. In addition, the publication date of the article corresponds to 2012. Considering the time that has elapsed, it would be important to update the article, considering the approach it uses (penalty of L1).
