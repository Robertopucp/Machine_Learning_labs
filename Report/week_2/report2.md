The article try to bring a solution to How to estimate dipersed hight-dimension linear regression models(HDS). The words "High-dimension" is because the number of regressors is greater than the number of the sample. The article show some of the main estimation methods for the HDS models.

In my opinion, I think that whe article has an informative function so it's difficult to know whats is the best method of estimation, is subjective. Maybe the structure of the paper helps to understand var well all the methods and also show examplos, which is very helpfull.
Maybe one weekness is that is the article is very tecnical so is easy to lost or get confused among all the equations.

The contributions is that expand the methods of how to estimate HDS models and this is helpfull because in the era of the data science now is common to work with high dimensional datasets so find a solution with this kind of estimations bring more tools to get more estimations to differents topics with news datasets.

The author mencioned that his next step is to make estimations to other model than the $L1$ penalty. Find solutions to other HDS with $L2$ penalty.
