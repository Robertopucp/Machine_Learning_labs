#### Article: Inference for High-Dimensional Sparse econometrics models
#### Autor: Belloni ,Chernozhukov, Hansen
<p style='text-align: justify;'> This article focuses on econometrics modelos of High-Dimensional Sparse (HDS). This models. The HDS are characterized by being in situations in which there is a large number of regressors, but it is not easy to determine which set of regressors is indicated for the model. The authors presents a wide variety of methods to find the most significant set of regressors and estimate their coefficients based on â„“1-penalization.<p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>The authors are thorough regarding all available methods for finding regressors. The article begins with a relatively simple (conventional) method, and then proposes more sophisticated methods (Lasso and Post-Lasso). Then, as the methods begin to present problems, new ones arise that fit much better, with much more reliable results (Indirect Post-Lasso,Double selection,Double selection Oracle and Oracle),until the last model (Double Lasso), which solves the problem of the non-robustness of the previous models. This structure makes the article more understandable and easy to go through. <p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>However, the weakness of the article is undoubtedly that it is written for a target audience, who had to have a solid basis of econometrics in order to understand the implications and uses of the exposed theory.<p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'> The motivation for considering HDS models comes in part from the wide availability of data sets with many regressors. An example of this need is the growth model of Solow, and the necesity to add more regresors  (variables measuring education ands cience policies, strength of market institutions , trade openness ,savings rates and others) for a proper examination of the future path of income distribution. <p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>  The Lasso method is just one of many others. That is why the authors emphasize the need to take other works into account. The analysis of high dimensional data presents a problem in economics that has many weak points yet to be solved, it is the job of economists to provide the appropriate tools and develop it. <p>
