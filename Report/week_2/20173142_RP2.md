# Report 2 - INFERENCE FOR HIGH-DIMENSIONAL SPARSE ECONOMETRIC MODELS

High dimensional sparse models arise in situations where many regressors (or series terms) are available, and the regression function is well aproximated by a parsimonious, yet unknown set of regressor.

 The purpose of this article is, by several methods,  identify a set of regressors that can estimate the regression function effectively and describe key theoretical results. For example,  the HDS model estimate the regression function via Penalization and Selection Methods, uses  L1-penalization or LASSO methods and post-selection estimators or Post-Lasso methods.
 In addition, the article discuss various econometric examples, present basic theoretical results, and illustrate the concepts and methods with Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application.

One of the strengths of this article is the way in which the l1- penalization are imposed on the regression function, detailing step by step in order to estimate it correctly. In other words, in addition to having literary support , empirical results can also be found.

Finally, it would also be interesting, as the author mentions, to consider the efficient use of high-dimensional data in cases where the scores are not independent between the observations, which is a highly regarded case in economics.
