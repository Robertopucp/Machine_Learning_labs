Nowadays, spreadsheets are essential in the computers as a way of manage the database of small and -even more- in large companies around the world. On it, you handle big data such as the amount of goods purchased, the types of goods people buy, dates, costumer's behaviors, etc. All of that can be useful in terms of information. Now, there are models that work with that information. Today, We will emphasize in a type of model that has revolutionized the world of data science: the High Dimensional Sparse. The HDS model will be discussed in the following paragraphs -the article was written by Belloni, Chernozhukov, and Hansen-.


First of all, I will begin by pointint out the goal of the authors' research: The authors try to answer the question, "What is the best way to make the regression function selections through the different estimation methods for HDS models that use the L1 penalty?"

Secondly, I will highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the article's approach to answer the question. 

On the one hand, one of the strengths is that the authors make a mathematical description of each econometric model to be used: they cite authors who supported every econometric model in empirical works, as well as they cite those authors whose empirical works did not obtain results in terms of robustness, precision, confidence intervals, and so on. Moreover, another of the strengths is that the authors make a comparison between models through numbers, probabilities: coefficients of every model, confidence intervals of them. Thus, you can draw inferences by yourself with that information. Finally, another important point is that the authors give to the researchers a variety of models so they can use each of them and choose which would be the most appropriate for their research. 

On the other hand, one of the weaknesses is that, although they emphasize the use of databases, there was no more meticulous description of causal inference or "intuition" - if you want to call it like that - of the data. Thus, the conclusions of each model described could have been understood by non-mathematicians, too. The article focused much more on the mathematical and statistical description (confidence intervals, coefficients, and so on) of each model.

Thirdly, the most remarkable of the article is that it provides a great contribution in terms of merging the bibliography of different authors to answer the question of finding the best regression function through the different estimation methods for HDS models that use the L1 penalty. Specifically, their contribution would be the main emphasis given to the use of instrumental variables and the linear partiality model.

Finally, we could stand out that the authors gave the main emphasis to the use of instrumental variables and the linear partiality model. Nevertheless, within the non-linear models need more depth in their research as well. Finally, there are also other models within the HDS whose dispersion assumption provides a poor approximation. That is why it is important to deepen into the investigation of these assumptions in empirical investigations.
