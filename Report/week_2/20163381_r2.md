This article focuses on the econometric models of High-Dimensional Sparse (HDS). HDS model are characterized by being in situations where there are a large number of regressors, but it is not simple to determine which set of regressors is indicated for the model. Authors present a wide variety of methods to find the most significant set of regressors and estimate their coefficients based on $l_1$-penalization.


One of the strengths of the article is that they expressly allow an imperfect selection of regressors and study the impact of this imperfect selection on the results of estimation and inference in order to capture realistic practical situations. In addition, his explanations are followed by econometric fundamentals and graphically shows how scattered approximations based on Lasso fit better compared to traditional models used in empirical economics.


The contribution of this article is based on the presentation of results for the analysis of data with a large number of covariates through the selection of relevant regressors and the estimation of their coefficients using $l_1$-penalization methods. It focuses primarily on the instrumental variables model and the partially linear model, both widely used to estimate structural economic effects. 

Is presented a set of novel inference results for these models and illustrated their use with applications for returns to schooling and growth regression. For the first case, the results demonstrate that the selection of the Lasso instrument is feasible and produces sensible estimates that appear to be of relatively high quality in this application. The second example concerns the use of $l_1$-penalized methods to select control variables for growth regressions in which there are many possible controls at the country level in relation to the number of countries. Using square-root-Lasso to select control variables, we found that there is evidence in favor of the convergence hypothesis.
With this it was possible to demonstrate that $l_1$-penalization methods can be used in a useful way in these models and can complement the tools commonly used by researchers.


The results of this article provide useful tools, but there are still important and interesting topics in the use of high-dimensional data that justify further research for the author.  The sup-score test presented in this article offers an approach to addressing this issue, but it seems necessary to conduct further research on this topic. In addition, with regard to the estimation of structural economic objects, it would be useful to consider and understand the behavior of other estimation methods.
