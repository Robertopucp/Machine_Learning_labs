This article attempts to answer about estimation and inference methods for high dimensional sparse (HDS) regression models with their use in the instrumental variables model and partially linear model. These models appear when the regression function is well-aproximated by a set of many unknown regressors, that's why is necessary to search the right set of covariates. The authors briefly present high-dimensional sparse models based on the mean regression model, but focus and discuss quantile regression methods and generalized linear models in high-dimensional sparse environments. They find that regularized l1 estimators have an inherent bias toward zero, thus, Post-Lasso performance, coupled as a function of the convergence ratio and the Lasso selection model, may be strictly better in some cases. This is proven in the Monte Carlo example, as Post-Lasso estimators perform better than Lasso estimators by having a lower shrinkage bias which helps in the prediction design. Also, from the Gauss equation, consider the linear instrumental variable (IV) model and the Lasso-based estimators show a good job in producing tests with size close to the nominal level. For the Fuller-Lasso case, it may do better than 2SLS-Lasso testing performance though they are very similar in the design. The tests based on IV-Lsso using the iterated penalty selection rule may perform better than tests based on IV-Lasso using cross-validation to choose the Lasso penalty levels, especially when the instruments have little explanatory power.

For the Angrist and Krueger example with 1530 instruments they find that Lasso instrument selection is feasible and produces sensible and relatively high quality estimates for this application, although the results of the Lasso-based IV estimators are similar to those estimation and inference approaches that do not require prior information. In the Growth example, they applied square-root Lasso to the regression of growth rates on log-GDP and other controls selected only one control, the log of the black market premium which characterizes trade openness. Thus, they find that the linear regression coefficients on the initial level of GDP are negative and zero is excluded from the 90% confidence interval in each case, supporting the hypothesis from Solow-Swam-Ramsey growth model.

Therefore, is important to focus on the analysis of high-dimensional data in which there are many weak signals within the set of variables considered in which the sparsity assumption may provide a poor approximation.
