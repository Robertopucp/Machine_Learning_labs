This article centers on the discussion of the different methods, specifically, the Lasso method used to estimate High-Dimensional Sparse (HDS)  models. As the authors explain, the estimation of a model of this nature is complicated: an HDS model has a great number of regressors compared to the size of the sample, but it is not certain which group of these regressors are relevant for the estimation. The Lasso method presented in the article tries to find this group of regressors in an efficient way so that the resulting model is the most parsimonious, yet still accurate. At the same time, the authors include pertinent adjustments to the method presented in order to expanse the applicability of the HDS models. 

The authors use the $l_1$-penalized and post $l_2$-penalized estimation methods. The former allows the construction of the Lasso estimator, solving the empirical oracle problem; the latter allows the construction of the Post-Lasso estimator, which corrects the bias of the Lasso model. The main benefit of the methodology proposed is that it considers several scenarios where the HDS model is applicable: lineal regressions, the instrumental variables (IV) method, inference levels, etc. At the same time, the authors prove how the proposed method yields better estimations than their traditional counterparts (for example, the 2SLS). 

The main contribution of this work is that it opens many possibilities for applied economists to work with high-dimensional data. It shows that there are efficient methods to estimate models that consider all relevant regressors, even when these are relatively larger than the sample. As the authors highlight at the end of the article, these advances allow for more empirical work to be done.

The next step would be to see how the proposed method works when applied to different sets of high-dimensional data, to verify how the estimations effectively yield better results, and to notice in which areas the method used in HDS requires further theorizing.</div>
