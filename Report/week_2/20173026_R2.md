High-dimensional models have gained considerable importance in several areas of economics, e.g. large panels of home-price data, cross-sectional effects, treatment-effects models, financial portfolio construction, etc. To the extend these models are getting important attention, so does its challenges.

This article aims to discuss econometric methods in order to i) identify the right set of regressors that can estimate the entire regression function effectively, ii) to estimate their coefficients based on $\ell_{1}$- penalization, and iii) to describe their theoretical results.

One of the strengths of this article is that most of its assumptions are well-developed and supported by previous literature. Plus, its explanations are followed by econometric foundations and graphically shows how Lasso-Based sparse approximations fits better in comparison whit traditional modelling used in empirical economics.  

This article contributions are notable as HDS models seems to be emerging in different fields as sciences, engineering, biology and finance, thanks to advances in computing technologies. 

Nevertheless, high-dimensional modeling poses numerous challenges related to statistical theory, methods, and implementations, and it is fundamental to better estimate variable selections. For example, there are two important phenomena in high-dimensional modeling:     

   * Spurious correlations  
   * Noise accumulation

The first one can be detected among the predictors, which creates an intrinsic difficulty of high-dimensional model selection. In addition to this, it has been shown that there can be high spurious correlation even for independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) predictors when $p$ is large compared with $n$. That is why conventional intuition might no longer be accurate when it comes about high-dimensional prediction. 

Finally, the second one has been noticed as a common phenomenon in high-dimensional predictions. Since explicit theoretical quantification of the impact of dimensionality on classification has not been well understood, then that classification which uses all features can be as bad as random guessing because of the noise accumulation in estimating the population centroids in high dimensions.
