The paper develops  estimation and inference methods for high dimensional sparse (HDS) regression model in a situation where there are p regressors, n sample size, and p>n. This last statement could lead us to think that no econometric estimation is possible, since this violates the full rank assumption. Nevertheless, the regression function can be approximated for a set of the regressors. In that sense, the authors use L1-penalization to identify this set of regressors and estimate them. Moreover, this has a strong theoretical and empirical approach where  instrumental variables model and the partially linear model are used for empirical applications. Thus, the research method could be: Are the penalty methods useful to estimate the models in the paper?

One advantage is that the authors use an empirical and theoretical research approach that complements the understanding of the paper. In second place, the paper has a good structure that helps to become familiar with the definitions, know the theory and evaluate the results through practical cases. 

Regarding the contributions, the authors separate the estimation methods and models which allows analysis for different scenarios where each one evaluates different methods and models. Additionally, expands the fields of analysis of variables in a context of a high number of regressors. This is achieved by expanding the application of lasso methods specifically to structural models, where lasso methods give computational relief and achieve rates of convergence similar to the one that the “true” model would give in each case. Finally, it would be interesting to apply estimation methods and models developed in the paper to other economic models.
