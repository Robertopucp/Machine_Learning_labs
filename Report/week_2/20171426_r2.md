The paper focuses the estimation and inference methods for high dimensional sparse (HDS) models that make use of the $l_1$ penalization. First, it shows the sparse and approximately sparse regression models an its conditions, as well as the sparse estimation methods such as the Iterated Lasso , The Square Root Lasso, among other variants of the feasible method. Later, it presents the properties of the estimation results for HDS models, focusing on the convergence rates for the Lasso and Post-Lasso. It also presentes the use of this methods in doing inference on structural effects with high-dimensional instruments and in inference on treatment and structural effects conditional on observables.

One of the strenghts of this paper, in my opinion, is the broad explanation about the approximately sparse regression model and the methods, such as the Iterated Lasso, used to solved the former. The understanding of the rest of the paper relays on this because it develops another more complex methods that are based on them, for example whe  using it in the inference on structural effects with high-dimensional instruments, thought they also have their own properties and conditions. Moreover, the use of well-explained examples helps the authors bring this concepts and properties to light in all the paper. The use of them also helps to clarify the contrasts between the models, such as Lasso and Post-Lasso in the Montecarlo example. 

Nevertheless, there are some issues that araise. First, althought the autors show a lot of the methods that are possible to use, I believe the robustness test presented should be more explained and compared since they helps us to hold the strenght if the methods used. Last, but not least, it can be a little tedious to process all the formalization of maths. As much as needed, the notation can be a little confusing in some parts. 

This paper advance knowledge about the research question because it provides a compillation of methods for HDS models and applications related to Economics, mostly. It provides justifications on why this methods can be more helpful in common scenarios nowadays, but without being greedy about the conditions and assumptions needed for that to happen. Apart from that, the paper could be improved. Since it presents a wide variety of methods, sometimes it seems a little short on some aspects, as robustness test, so that should be considered.
