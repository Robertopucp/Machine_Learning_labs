The article deals with estimation and inference methods for high-dimensional sparse regression models (HDS). The HDS regression model consists of a large number of regressors, p, which in many cases are greater than the sample size, n, but it requires that the model be sparse. The motivation for this article is that data sets with many regressors are widely available today. Thus, the article reviews the main estimation methods for HDS models, which use a penalty, providing results of infrequency. In addition, it shows empirical examples that illustrate the HDS methods and models in econometrics. The paper dont have strengths and weaknesses, because I think it is a descriptive paper. 

The paper is organized as follows: for the first section, the article present the concepts of sparce and aproximately sparse regression; also, it shows some empirical examples, in which the HDS model is used. In the second seccion, they analize somre principal estimation methods and mention extensions of thats methods to applications beyond conditional mean models. For the next section, they discuss the results of the methods mentioned in the previous section. They then develop HDS models and methods on instrumental variable models with a large number of instruments. This goes hand in hand with the many-term linear model that you develop in the next section. Finally, they show two empirical examples to motivate the use of the HDS method.

The article concludes that in economics there are many situations in which the economist has access to data with a large number of covariates. Thus, the econometric models described serve as a great tool for this type of situation.
