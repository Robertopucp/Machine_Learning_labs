Reporte 2: High Dimensional Sparse Econometric Models: An Introduction

What is the purpose of the paper? This paper analyzes the estimation and inference methods of high-dimensional sparse regression models (HDS) in econometrics. For this, among the strengths of the paper, for the mentioned analysis, there are the applicative examples and the motivation. This is precisely because the article analyzes HDS models in order to motivate the reader to use them. The motivation mentioned by the authors comes in part from the wide availability of data sets with many regressors, since the HDS regression model allows a large number of regressors (p) that is possibly much larger than the sample size (n), but imposes that the model be sparse. Now, to put this in context, a sparse matrix is when there are some elements of the matrix that are different from 0. This definition is important to better understand the authors' analysis. That is, the authors assume that only (s) <<n of the regressors (p) are important in capturing the main features of the regression function. This assumption is important because it allows efficient estimation of HDS models through the approximate search for an appropriate set of regressors. 

The paper responds to the above objective by first defining some of the concepts of sparse and approximately sparse regression models in the canonical context of modeling a conditional mean function and also performing empirical and analytical examples. Among the main assumptions of the approximately sparse or nonparametric model: (i) All regressors potentially have a non-zero contribution to the regression function, but it does not need more than the unknown regressors to approximate the regression function with a sufficient degree of accuracy. We define the approximately sparse model: ASM condition. We have the function yi=f(zi)+qi (1). The ASM condition is more general in the sense that it does not impose that the most important s terms are the first s terms. In fact, the identities of the most important terms are treated as unknown. The objective of the function Yi= x'B0+ri, which is an approximately sparse form of the function f(zi), in estimation is the parametric function x'B0, where T = support(β0) is called the "true" model. The final objective of the estimation is f(zi). The function x'B0 is a convenient intermediate objective introduced so that we can approach the estimation problem as if it were parametric. In fact, the two aforementioned objectives are equal up to the approximation error ri. Therefore, the problem of estimating the parametric target x'B0 is equivalent to the problem of estimating the nonparametric target f(zi) by modulating the approximation errors. 

The natural question from the above is whether exact or approximate HDS models make sense in econometric applications. For this the authors pose two applicative examples such as sparse models for income regressions. 

Then, they discuss some main estimation methods. They also discuss some key estimation results for HDS methods and mention several extensions of these results. They (authors) go on to develop HDS models and methods in instrumental variables models with many instruments, in which they mention that in these cases, sparse models select a small subset of the available technical instruments. And, the main regularity condition is the ASIV and HDIV condition. And, finally, they present two empirical examples that motivate the use of these methods. 

It should be noted that the article mentions the need for further extensions of the HDS models for each type of high-dimensional data. For example, the efficient use of high-dimensional data in cases where scores are not independent among observations.
