# INFERENCE FOR HIGH-DIMENSIONAL SPARSE ECONOMETRIC MODELS

## Franco Caceres Vasquez

High dimensional sparse (HDS) models usually arise when we have data sets in which dimensions of data vectors (regressors of a model) are equal or even more than the sample size and when the regression function is well-approximated by a parsimonious, yet unknown set of regressors.

The purpose of this article is to study a specific way of identify the right set of regressors in a HDS regressions models making use of l1-penalization (especially instrumental variable model and partially linear model).

Something that can be highlighted of this paper is that there is really a rich and wide research about different sparse estimation methods, such as l1-penalized and post l1-penalized estimation methods, among others, and how these methods can be used because there are a lot of empirical evidence. It is also very impressive how this article gives some examples about how can we apply this HDS models in econometrics, as the sparse model for earning regressions.

This is a really useful paper because it explains in detail how can we use the different methods when we are dealing with high dimensional data with many weak signals within the set of variables considered but it would be good, as the author mentioned, to consider efficient use of high-dimensional data in cases in which scores are not independent across observations.
