<p style='text-align: justify;'> Nowadays, data availability is vast due to the technological development we can capture or have more information on variables that we did not have before. Therefore, high-dimensional sparse models (HDS) arise when faced with a situation where many regressors are available, and the regression function is well approximated by only an unknown but convenient set of regressors. In this article, although the authors do not state a research question explicitly, they explain how methods for estimation and inference of high-dimensional sparse regression (HDS) models are approached in econometrics. They also discuss methodologies for identifying the appropriate set of regressors to enter them into the regression function thus and estimate their coefficients based on the ℓ1-penalization method and describe key theoretical results focusing on using HDS models and methods in the instrumental variables model and the partially linear model. As mentioned above, I consider that the question that explains the whole article is the following:: is the ℓ1-penalization method useful for estimating high-dimensional sparse regression models?

<p style='text-align: justify;'> This article is aimed at applied researchers, as it is purely theoretical-mathematical for the most part, which is better explained in the appendices in case the reader has not understood in depth. Considering the objectives and research question, they present the models, theorems, conditions, and assumptions concisely and mathematically grounded to understand the different methods (Lasso sparse approximation, post-Lasso, Square Root Lasso, among others).  Furthermore, it is discussed how to select relevant regressors to explain the endogenous variable is performed and presents the results of the estimations performed. In addition, the authors do not stop at the explanation of the theory but complement it with examples such as sparse models for earning regression or the Monte Carlo experiment. To develop the article, the authors rely on previous studies, most of them their own, so that this article can be understood as a continuity of the work previously done.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> The article's contribution is more linked to econometrics and opens a way to use new useful tools such as the penalty method ℓ1 that allow us to deal with high dimensional economic data. While these models, can be mainly used in the social sciences, it is also used in finance, or any area that analyzes the behavior of regressor and endogenous variables) such as engineering. Nevertheless, there are still interesting issues that need to be investigated. Since the authors focus on a single method (ℓ1-penalization) to estimate regressions with high-dimensional data, it would be interesting to estimate structural economic effects by other methods. Similarly, it would be interesting to see how the ℓ1-penalization method performs when we extend it to economic models rather than the instrumental variables model or the partially linear model. Also, as the authors indicates, in economics, in the analysis of high dimensional data, the dispersion assumption could provide a poor approximation if the variables considered giving weak signals of being appropriate. It is also possible to analyze the cases in which the scores between observations are not independent when using high-dimensional data.
