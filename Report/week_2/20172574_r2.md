When you have many regressors and you are not sure which one to use for estimation then you must use High dimensional sparse models because of this and to avoid errors in the estimation the authors review the different HDS models, their methodology and apply it to empirical cases.

The paper has both a theoretical and an empirical approach. First, a deep theoretical presentation is made, where the sparse model, its extensions and methods are defined. Subsequently, the results given by each type of method are estimated. For the case of HDS the authors conclude that the best methods are Post-Square-root Lasso and Post-Iterated Lasso because they present a lower shrinkage bias. For the case of instrumental variable model, the Lasso-Based IV methods is the best because it generates less bias. Finally, for Partially Linear models the best method is the double-Post-Lasso method.


The authors' contribution is that they use empirical examples to analyze the performance of the sparse methods and econometric models previously proposed by various authors.  For example, they analyze the Angrist and Krueger (1991) model containing 1540 instruments and using the Lasso method and only 12 instruments they find that the Lasso-base IV estimator is like the other methods with thousands of instruments and that it does not require ex ante information on which instruments are relevant. 
On the other hand, using the Post Square-root Lasso, Post Double selection and data methods of Barro and Lee (1994) confirm the convergence results presented by Barro and Sala-i-Martin(1995)


The authors focused on methods with l1-penalization, and it is precisely an advance that would motivate the use or investigation of methods with l2-penalization. 
On the other hand, it is important to consider the impact of high-dimensional data in the use of sparse models because it could generate erroneous results.
