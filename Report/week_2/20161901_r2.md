## Paper: Belloni, Chernozhukov, and Hansen (2017). Inference for High-Dimensional Sparse Econometric models
### Name: Alexander Pacheco (20161901)

The article aims to review econometric methods to estimate high dimensional sparse (HDS) models in order to identify an accurate set of regressors from a large number of possbile ones. This kind of models arises when the availability of data allows to have many regressors that could be even larger than the number of observations. Thus, the authors analyze some methods (Lasso and its variations) to find an appropriate set of regressors and to estimate their coefficients of HDS models with L1 penalization.

The strengths of the paper are its strong theoretical and econometric approach and its subsequent empirical application. However, this characteristics could be a weakness if the reader does not have a solid background in mathematical and statistical knowledge.

In addition, the contribution to the literature of the paper is its proposal of different estimation methodologies in differente situations. For example, for the HDS models, they propose Post-iterated Lasso and IV Lasso when trying to capture structural effects.
