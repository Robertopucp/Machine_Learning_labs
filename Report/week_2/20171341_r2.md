# Report 2

* Which is the research question of the article?

The  article wants to explore estimation and inference methods exist for High Dimensional Sparse regression models . Thus the research could be understood as “Which methods can be used to perform estimations and inference in a HDS model context?”

* What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering that question?

The article approaches the research question in a well structured way which makes it more understandable because it combines a strong theoretical explanation and some practical examples about how the models work . First, it introduces the sparsity concept and how it is found in Economic research, after this the article presents and compare estimation methods for HD models and instruments via simulations. Then some actual data examples are presented in order to show how the analyzed models perform in real life.  

Since the article is focused on a theoretical explanation, the use of notation it’s not a problem. Nonetheless, it could be hard to read at the first time by someone who is not used to mathematical notation.

* How does this document advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided to publish the article.)

The main contribution of the paper is the comparition of models to find which of them performs better in each wanted scenario. The paper not only restricts it’s analysis to HDS models but it also explores the IV scenario. The paper uses computational developments of recent years in an interesting way, 30 years ago it could have been impossible -or at least very complicated- to perform that amount of simulations for each wanted specification. 

| Scenario   |      Best method      |  Second best method |
|----------  |      :-------------:  |      ------:        |
| HDS Models |  Post-iterated Lasso | Post-square-root Lasso |
| Strucural effects ith HD Instruments (depends on the Instruments number) |    IV-Lasso | FULL-Lasso |
| Treatment and structural effects | Double selection|    Indirect Post-Lasso |

Furthermore, the paper increases it’s value when performing the analyzed models on real-life data which has been already analyzed years ago without this methodological improvements. Thus the paper shows how useful this improvements can be for research. 

* What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to move forward on this question?

In the conclusions it’s mentioned that “there are many avenues for additional research”. More specifically it mentions that ana analysis of such methods would be interesting for estimating structural effects. The examples showed restrict it’s analysis for US data , so exploring data from developing countries would help to answer economic questions that may arise.
