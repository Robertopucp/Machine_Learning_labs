# LECTURE OF INFERENCE FOR HIGH-DIMENSIONAL SPARSE ECONOMETRIC MODELS

## Name: Morales Lopez Erik Brandon

### Questions about the paper:

1. What is the research question of the article?

- this article is about estimation and causal inference methods for high-dimensional situations. But the main question of that is on the uses of HDS models and methods in instrumental variables and the partially linear model. There are some results for these models with their applications to returns schooling and growth regressions. 


2. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering that question?

- One of the weaknesses is the paper is focused only of the uses of l1 penalization, but it would be interested to consider other studies for estimate economic object. For example, the low signals. One of the strengths is the paper focus on showing a set of regressors and estimate coefficients in order to describe theoretical results. 

3. How does this document advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided to publish the article.)

- the way to approuch this research is not enought considering other high dimensional economic topics in which case may be the weak signal and giving a provide poor aproximation. The document only take the l1 penalization to estimate the high dimensional data. Therefore, I consider necesary to take more studies that addresses the behavior of other methods.


4. What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to move forward on this question?

- In summary, in this paper the researcher focused on results to perform analysis of such data selecting relevant regressors and estimating their coefficients l1 penalization methods. Therefore, I consider relevant the paper must be interesting to understand the behavior of other methods for estimating economics objects, because I, as mention before, the use of l1 penaliztion is one method to esmitate with high-dimensional data. In addition, in economics  there are cases which the high-dimensional data are weak signals within the set of variables considered, but the problem begins with the sparsity assumption and the aproximation becomes poor. So, the high score presented on it offers a approach with high dimensional models, but is necesary more research in cases in which where weak signals and score are not independent.
