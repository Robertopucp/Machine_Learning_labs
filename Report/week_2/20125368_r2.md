This article seeks to answer the question of how to estimate dispersed high-dimension linear regression models (HDS), where the number of regressors (p) is greater than 
the number of the sample (n), of which only s regressors will be selected. , where s << n.To do this, the authors analyze the various methods that help identify the set
of regressors s, estimate the coefficients of these regressors based on the l1 penalty, and describe the theoretical results.

I think the strength of this article is that the way the text is structured helps to answer the research question more assertively. As the reading progresses, the 
author presents models, compares them, and chooses the best estimation methods according to the scenario. Likewise, the authors also propose a model with structural 
effects with high-dimensional Instruments and a model with treatment and structural effects conditional on observables used to estimate structural effects. For each 
case, it also compares and chooses the best estimation methods: Post-iterated Lasso, IV-lasso, and Double selection, respectively.

The article's contribution, in addition to what has already been mentioned, is that it also presents empirical examples where it is possible to apply the models and 
their different estimation methods. Specifically: (i) review Angrist and Krueger's (1991) classical instrumental variable estimation of returns to education; and (ii) 
reviews the use of penalized methods, l1, to select control variables for growth regressions in which there are many possible controls at the country level concerning 
the number of countries.

Finally, the additional steps to advance in answer to the research question are mentioned in the article: on the one hand, use other methods to make estimates other 
than the l1 penalty; on the other hand, extend the HDS models and methods to others. Types of economic models beyond those considered in this article. Finally, it 
would also be interesting to consider efficient use of high-dimensional data in cases in which scores are not independent across observations which is a 
much-considered case in economics.
